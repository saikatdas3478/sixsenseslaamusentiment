Review
"For us it is a very special and the most wonderfull resort you can find on earth.  The island itself it‚Äòs magical and the moment you reach there and removing your shoes, you‚Äòre in another, a better world.  All the staff is an unbeliveable team, which feels like one big family. This time, especially Shah, our GEM, made it, to such an memorable and unforgetable stay once again. But it‚Äòs really difficult to find words to descripe all this, you have to go there an just feel it!"
"Where to start‚Ä¶ Six Senses Laamu was simply exceptional! My wife and I were visiting to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary so we wanted somewhere special, this resort did not disappoint.  The whole experience starting from arriving at Male airport was absolutely flawless. All staff were very friendly, professional and attentive, nothing was too much trouble.  The island was stunning as was our over water villa.  We spent so much time snorkelling as there was so much to see. There were lots of other activities available, so you really could do as much or as little as you want.  The food was really good, theme nights were great, restaurant and kitchen staff were brilliant.  Special mention to our GEM Pablo.  He was awesome, an absolute credit to Six Senses. He arranged everything for us and his suggestions were always spot on, making the trip that bit more special.  We cannot thank him enough.  Thanks to everyone‚Ä¶ we really hope to be able to return!‚Ä¶"
"My second time to this resort, the resort is incredible, the staff amazing, great food, the surf is excellent and the marine research centre is next level!! My family will definitely be making a third trip! Shah in guest services was our GEM and he was amazing so too Saif and Monty from tropic surf‚Ä¶"
"We had the best time at six senses, a most beautiful hotel in the perfect setting, amazing water and nature, fantastic food every night, best pancakes in the morning, wonderful staff all round - the resort is pure heaven. A big thank you to our star GEM Shah and also to Kul and shah at the restaurants for looking after us so well - we will def be back!!! Soon I hope üå¥üíô"
"The experience of staying in Six Senses Laamu overpass all the expectations.  The staff put love in all the details of our stay.  Always present to grant that we had the  best experience ever. The over water room was outstanding. The food was simply delicious.  Also the kindness of the staff was amazing, specially, the professionalism of our GEM, Pablo, who has always been available, friendly and of great help! We will return for sure and recommend it for everyone!"
"Six Senses Laamu is one of a kind‚Ä¶ combining artistic landscapes with the kindness of the ambient! It is a nature experience enhanced by the competence and willing to help of Pablo, our wonderful GEM and all of the hotel staff, everyone with a friendly smile in their faces!"
"My partner and I had the best stay at Six Senses Laamu and cannot adequately describe how beautiful it is, with its incredible beaches, beautiful clear water in photogenic shades of blue, and natural wood buildings that blend seamlessly into the environment.    We loved our over-water villa with its luxurious and complete privacy, outdoor shower, hammock over the water, top-notch music speakers, and TV that can be watched from the bedroom, or ingeniously turned so you can watch it from the glass bathtub, or tucked entirely into the wall, hidden away.  As for the food - we were overwhelmed with the choices, beautiful presentation, and amazing flavours reflecting cuisines from the Maldives, Asia and Europe. Be sure to try the pandan pancakes, Sri Lankan hoppers, and Thai som tam at the Asian buffet!  What makes Six Senses Laamu most special though is the staff who are some of the kindest and most genuinely friendly people you could hope to meet; from General Manager Marteyne who encourages everyone to get in the water to dive, and who has a passion for the ocean that supports the fantastic marine science team based at the new SHELL building, to the knowledgeable dive centre manager Anne and her team (if you dive, be sure to do a dive with Izaaz who will not only show you amazing stuff but make special bubble rings on the safety stop), to the landscaping manager Adam who we saw walking around with a sweet little pet parrot which he introduced to a small child, to everyone‚Äôs delight!   So many experiences, big and small, were testament to the kindness and dedication of the staff.  We loved it so much we came back, and are already thinking about a future visit!‚Ä¶"
"What a place! We were on our honeymoon with our baby and had the best time.   Everything was seemless - the moment you thought of something, it had already been taken care of. About the only thing you had to think about was getting dressed in the morning and this was largely down to Ath-Har, our incredibly talented GEM.  Every single member of staff made an incredible effort to make our son too and made him feel like a true VIP."
One of the bestest vacation we had with family.From service to food to kids activities couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better vacation.Really liked the fact instead of preaching they are actually following sustainability in everything.The food and the service from all the staff members highly appreciated.
"It‚Äôs our 7th trip to the Maldives and fourth stay at Six Senses Laamu and we can‚Äôt wait for our fifth stay! I guess the return trips say it all! We absolutely love this resort thanks to the management and staff who are the most genuine, warmest, kind hearted people you will meet. The staff are dedicated to ensuring you have the trip of a lifetime. We love snorkeling and Six Senses has one of the best house reefs in the Maldives. It‚Äôs so magical with abundant marine life including turtles and reef sharks thanks to the ongoing marine conservation by the marine biology team based now at the new  SHELL. We have been visiting Six Senses Laamu since 2016 and honestly every time we visit it exceeds all expectations.  Special gratitude and thanks to Marteyne and her amazing team ‚Äì especially Mina, Hollo, Hisham, Katoo and Nick. See you again soon ÔÅä‚Ä¶"
"It is a really 5 stars hotel! Amazing, beautiful, perfect, and I have much experience in Maldivian hotels!  I would like to say huge thanks to the tropic surf crew: Erin, saif, the others I forgot the name but they were awesome too! Surf was very good to epic! The food is hand made and very tasty, there‚Äôs 50 flavors of ice cream flavors that you can taste all day long! Thanks 6 senses, I will come back for sure!"
"5 out of 5   Great service from start to finish. Fantastic restaurants and loads of choice with some fantastic themed nights.  Personal service through your stay and big thanks to Ath Har our GEM.  Our ocean beach villa was amazing and very private. Breakfast in the villa was an added bonus as it is served a bit later than in the restaurant.  Loads to do if you are the active type. We mainly chilled the entire time but the fishing, snorkelling and cookery classed were great fun.   Highly recommend this 5 (6 if we could officially rate it) star resort"
"Six senses was an incredible experience for our family.  The expertise and service from staff was impeccable from the minute you stepped on the island. A special mention to our GEM Shah, who was available to attend to all requests. Some highlights were the snorkelling tours, scuba diving opportunities and the newly acquired sea plane.  We will be back! "
"We had a wonderful time at Six Senses, the island is the true meaning of paradise on Earth. Team work was awesome, very kind with us, facilities were perfect, delicious food and drinks, and the details, how amazing, everywhere full of details that make a difference of making this experience even more unique. The Villa we staid at whas so beautiful and full of joy. Special thanks to the team and for the persons that made out honeymoon the best time of our lives. Mr Ath-har that took special care of us since the minute 1 that we arrived till the last minute on the Island. Pakkeday making our breakfast so delicious and full of happines. Nnwodwa who we called Deeva, so kind with us with her beautiful smille every time that she saw us, making out fruits even more delicious. Akul with‚Ä¶"
Stayed at Six Senses Resort late September/ early October for 10 perfect nights. This was our second stay and it was as magical as the first. The resort continues to be  beautifully maintained with attention to every detail. The reef and snorkelling was a treat with an abundance of marine life. Plenty of turtles and beautiful corals to enjoy! Highly recommend the sunset fishing - plenty of fish (and amazing and friendly boat staff) and our GEM arranged for a feast of our freshly caught fish (pictured). Food is exceptional! But what makes this resort so special is ALL the staff. We had the best GEM - Shah who looked after our every need and was so lovely and approachable. Shah is a Star and a  pleasure to deal with ! We will be back :)
"Six Senses Laamu is a marvellous property to stay at, with lovely employees and substantial customer service.  With our family, we‚Äôve stayed at Six Senses Laamu in two Laamu over water villas in the beginning of June 2022. We were almost the only family. More than 60% are honeymooners, which is quit logically according to their prices.   After our long flight from Amsterdam to the Maldives, we got on a local flight which was about 45 minutes. We did not have to wait that long. Check in and handling off by one of the employees of Six Senses was very smooth. After a 50 minute flight we were transported by boat to the Laamu Lagoon.  Our GEM Abdullah was amazing, so attentive, friendly and generous. We couldn‚Äôt wish for a better gem than him. He‚Äôs arranged so many thing for us. At‚Ä¶"
"Fantastic resort, makes you feel taken care and pampered during your stay. A specific GEM/a person, follows your wishes and needs.  Food: great selection, my favourite are Japanese and Mediterranean.  Reef is full of colourful fish and corals. Snorkelling is the best right under your cabin and 50 m radius.  Very into sustainability. Everything are made of natural products. Except the plastic water boiler. It should be stainless steel. We would love to come back.  Special thanks to our GEM Atthar."
"Our stay at Six Senses Laamu was phenomenal!  We were hugely impressed by the new SHELL building and everything going on there. Home to the MUI marine team, they study, help protect, and provide fascinating insight into the marine environment of the Maldives. We dropped by the SHELL several times where we did a tour with a marine biologist, chatted with a coral specialist, watched underwater videos on a giant screen, played with the interactive installations (fun for all ages!), and took photos with the life-size mantas gliding gracefully overhead.   I highly recommend going to an evening presentation at the ice cream parlour while enjoying one of the plethora of home made ice cream flavours - we learned about turtles, sharks, fish intelligence (!), and sustainable fishing in‚Ä¶"
"Very happy with Six Senses Laamu.  The trip from the local airstrip is a great start to any holiday albeit this will hardly be unique in the Maldives.   The communal areas at this resort are generous and the spa and other restaurants and pool areas around the island make every day that little bit different.  Most staff were very friendly and helpful and provide excellent service.  Quality of the food was excellent - price of drink though was v high.  One or two staff stood out (sommelier Ritesh and cocktail maker Wayne) but special mention to our GEM, Amsood even if he did take two days off while we were there (üòâ). A huge plus is the marine research facility operated by the Maldives Underwater Initiative (MUI).  They provide great snorkeling and diving guides both around the‚Ä¶"
There is no need of saying it was wonderful. We forgot the fatigue of flying far and long. GEM was so kind as well as everyone were kind and warm. We‚Äôve been cared well. Food was so nice and tasty. Under water you can see everything you imagined for. I want to come back!!!!
"Amazing experience. Beautifulr house, excellent food and good wine list(especially champagne), snorkle with the turtle. Nice people( thx to out gem abdulla). It was my best holiday ever. If you plan to maldives, six senses will be good choice. "
"Wonderful resort, great concept, excellent staff and service, delicious food!  Our GEM Abdulla and Samah, our Sommelier from India, the waiter(s) at the restaurant, the fruitlady Asrie, the diving team (our guide Judith), as well as all the other staff members, they were all so wonderful, very attentive and friendly and kind and offered great service and are all very professional."
"It was a great experience at Six Senses. Everything here was perfect, the sky, the ocean, the people. We had a lot of wonderful experiences on the island, snorkeling at the amazing house reef, enjoying spa with the sound of waves, and doing yoga in front of the sea. Above all that, it was the amazing staff here that made this trip special, especially our GEM, Tanny, who is energetic and welcoming with her big smile. Tanny is responsive to all our messages and could always help with our requests. She ensured that we could have the full experience we want for the holiday. We‚Äôll miss her and everything else on the island after we leave. Hope we will come back someday in the future."
Made memories for a lifetime‚Ä¶ Six senses Laamu team you made my sons 2nd birthday magical.. Our GEM Pablo made sure our stay was the most stunning and comfortable.. He went out of the way to check for my kids meals everyday and also took care of the minutest of details for our daily agenda at the resort. Beautifully organized my sons birthday celebration with a theme cake and planned our activities daily with ease. It was a wonderful experience to have a GEM take care of you and your needs during the stay. Shell was a wonderful experience too. Kudos!  Would have loved to enjoy a few live entertainment evenings at the property which we felt were missing. 
Our experience maker was amazing and so helpful making this trip one to remember. They had a sports match that people on the island went to watch and it couldn‚Äôt have been more than entertaining. There is a very large garden with a variety of herbs and vegetables to help display their sustainability and every staff member you go past us more than willing to greet you. Highly recommend and would most definitely go back.
"It was wonderful. We had a great time. Everything: the food, the villa, the staff, shah our Jem, the turtles and snorkeling with them, the yoga class, the massage. What a wonderful experience. everything was such a pleasure. Thank you six senses. We will come back and really looking forward to."
"We came home! It was our 2nd time at Laamu and it really felt like coming home. Such a warm welcome from all the team and especially Shah, our GEM. The whole week was out of ordinary and filled & spiked with heartfelt surprises like specials on my birthday, big smiles and ""welcome back"" from the staff in all areas. My mom speaks rarely English, so the team did organize a special walk around with a German staff member in the SHELL (sea hub for environmental learning in Laamu). A big thank you for the extraordinary service during breakfast and dinner in all 4 restaurants - thank you Kathu and Shah from restaurant team - you do a wonderful job! When you visit make sure to spend some time in this learning space and talk to the staff.  Also enjoy the learning hour - changing sessions‚Ä¶"
"this  is my best journey all over my life.  we got a very good GEM who is Shah ahmed.  He help us to start a magnificent adventure in six senses.   the service  is good,  room is good  and food is good esp leaf and zen.  we even do  5 snorkling  here.   we never do it before.  everthing is a magic.   i like  it.

"Everything was so perfect that I have no words to describe it. The place is beautiful and everything is so taken care, but what makes it more special is their people. Every single employee has always a smile on their faces and makes everything within their reach to make your stay even better.  A place being beautiful does not mean anything without very nice people and Six Senses Laamu has it all.  Wherever I go that I find a Six Senses, I am sure that's where I want to be.  I shall give special note to my GEM, Sobah, who was beyond words to make my stay even more memorable!"
"We had the best days of our lives in the Six Senses Laamu resort! Everything was simply PERFECT. It was luxurious but ‚Äúdown to earth‚Äù, allowing for an unparalleled connection with nature. We were pampered by the staff, who kindly fulfilled ALL OUR WISHES and requested ensuring that we get the most out of the experience. It was heaven on earth! Special THANKS to our incredible gem (general experience manager), Thoheer. He was simply amazing! "
We stayed in Laamu water villa and sunset Laamu water villa. Tanny was soooooo nice and she gave us lots and lots of help and advice. Every part of this resort has been designed in natural style but u can still get all u need here. And that is fabulous. I love all the staff here. I love Six Senses.
Maldives always one of our bucket list. We choose Six Senses Laamu for our Anniversary and we made the right decision. Everything was perfect. Especially our GEM Abdulla really made it beyond our expectation. 
"I will always be loyal to Six Senses, this‚Äôs my 2nd stay with the brand and now I couldn‚Äôt plan any vacation without checking out Six Senses properties. The level of service, and the sustainable values they hold, that‚Äôs what made Six Senses different than any other brands.   Abdullah, our GEM, made our stay more comfortable and pleasant. As he is always looking out for us and making sure we enjoy our time."
"What an absolutely stunning place! The island is picture-perfect. The resort was flawless, and the staff were incredibly welcoming and friendly, in particular our GEM, Hollo.  Hollo took extremely good care of my son and I, booking in all our activities and answering all of my many questions. Hollo even went above and beyond when I wasn't feeling well to send me a Lemon ginger healer to my Villa, a gesture that I was very grateful for and will always remember the kindness shown. The housekeeping staff were also exceptional, always keeping our villa tidy and ensuring we had plenty of water bottles to drink. Can not wait to come back for another holiday soon!"
A very beautiful and relaxing place and for those who like sports there was kayaking and snorkeling as well.   Good food and good service friendly staff  Bicycles were provided for guest to move around  
" ‚ÄúWhy would people write a review?‚Äù, was certainly one of the questions I had asked myself as I read through countless experiences of hotel guests throughout Maldives. This was early August, and we certainly did not know where should we go for our honeymoon in Maldives in mid-September. Maldives is after all a country with an endless number of islands and resorts. How do we choose one that works for us? After weeks of scrolling and referrals from family and friends who have visited Maldives, we came across Six Senses. It definitely ticked all the boxes - it has values such as sustainability, coral reefs for snorkeling, a five star dive center, yoga sessions, and over water ocean villas.   Hence we proceeded to engage the Reservations Team there. A huge shoutout to  Maaish,‚Ä¶"
" We have stayed in many luxury resorts in the Maldives, but Six Senses Laamu is different. We would like to compliment the whole team for making our stay such a wonderful pleasure and Soba, our ‚Äòguide‚Äô on the island gave us the best service and advice.  Ultimate barefoot luxury experience, beautiful nature on the island, house reef is amazing and best: breakfast, lunch and dinner, all OVER WATER!  - The design of the Water Villas, beautiful greyish teak wood, so pure and classic. Loved the big space, water front. Our daughter (4) loved to bike everywhere and enjoyed the private pool of our villa. The view is amazing, you can snorkel straight in front of your villa. For villas the Beach Villa is a wonderful option with your chill room for adolescent kids with Wifi (for chilling‚Ä¶"
"We had the most incredible stay at Six Senses Laamu. It was a perfect combination of relaxing, exploring, amazing activities and learning. Our GEM was an absolute gem and helped with everything we needed! I can't wait to visit again! "
The staff and location (marine life) make this place an amazing experience.  Every detail is carefully looked after to ensure that guests have a memorable experience.  Feels like staff are genuinely invested.  We are particularly grateful to Sobah (who was our GEM and looked after us throughout) and Coco who is extremely passionate about the marine life and sustainability efforts.
"Best holiday ever!!! We spent the most magical week on the island. Aided by our amazing GEM Shah, we explored everything on and around the island. Attended lectures at MUI, surfed with Tropic Surf, ate delicious food, snorkeled, massages. What a dream!! We‚Äôll be back next year!!"
"We stayed at Six Sense Laamu and had the most amazing holiday. The service was fantastic, particularly from Shah, our amazing GEM (guest experience maker) who put so much effort into making our stay special. Everything about the island and the resort is spectacular, including the food, snorkelling, surfing, rooms and beauty. We hope to come back one day.  "
"Villa was spotless and housekeeping comes twice a day to make sure we had water refilled and there was essential oils and pillow menus! The view from the overwater villas were spectacular and we even saw 3 rays swimming right in front of the villa!   Food at Leaf was our favourite and the Asian themed night was fun and fabulous. You might have heard bad reviews about food in Maldives being very ‚Äòhotel food‚Äô but Six Senses will surprise you! We had omakase and course dinners with really yummy ingredients (think: Mangalica pork). Every night we had the privilege of chatting with Retheesh the head sommelier who shared his knowledge, experience on wine and life! Special call out to our favourite wait staff Ansaar who we thoroughly enjoyed chatting to at Leaf and Chill Bar. We loved‚Ä¶"
"I‚Äôve stayed at a few Six Senses properties around the world and have loved those and have to say that Laamu sits on top of that list for me. The resort‚Äôs surroundings are breathtakingly beautiful, the architecture is gorgeous and sustainable, the food is really good with enough variety and the dive center is top notch. But what makes this hotel better than most others is the staff, their warmth and quality of service. Our GEM, Hamzath, was absolutely amazing - always warm, friendly and ready to help. Hamzath and the staff made me feel very much at home during my weeklong stay. This may not matter to everyone but the resort‚Äôs focus on sustainability shines through everything - it also has a state of the art Underwater Initiative called She‚Äôll which houses expert marine biologists‚Ä¶"
"  Our stay at six senses laamu was amazing.  What struck me most was the unexpected harmony with nature and more detailed the love for the underwaterworld. Six Senses aims for an experience never to forget and they give their guests all the opportunities to discover.  The food was very good with Leaf restaurant as my favorite!   The ice cream place is amazing! Lots of flavors and I could not find any I did not like.  Special thanks to the dive center for helping me with some paperwork and being able to do the dives that really are special to the Maladives.   Last but not least, or GEM Shah who made the whole experience just even better. He has amazing people skills and actually made us feel at home right a way! This way we could enjoy the stay from the first minute. He‚Ä¶"
"For our anniversary we had a wonderful stay at the Six Senses Laamu resort in the Maldives. Our GEM (Guest Experience Maker) Shah, was excellent! Because of Shah‚Äôs service and personable expertise, our experience was amazing, 10/10!!!!   We stayed in the ‚ÄòOcean Water Villa‚Äô which was amazing. From our villa we could spot turtles and sometimes even baby sharks.  The villa was cleaned several times a day, very pleasant.  The food was very good, our favorite restaurant was ‚ÄòLeaf‚Äô. A yummy ice cream at the ice cream bar could not be missed - lots of delicious flavors. My favorite was stracciatella and pistachio.  All the staff were super. They were always there to help us.  Six Senses Laamu is a beautiful place we will return to purely based on our dedicated GEM Shah!"
"My husband and I had high expectations for this hotel but they were all completely exceeded. The hotel is gorgeous and super well maintained: they care for every little detail, the island and all the sea animals with a sustainable approach, with a 5-star (plus) standard. Don‚Äôt even get me started on our GEM (which is the person responsible for managing your stay): Ath-har was truly a gem, so knowledgeable, pleasant, fun and responsive. Couldn‚Äôt have imagined a better manager for our stay. The food is absolutely amazing, and I‚Äôve never seen such an outstanding breakfast. It was a trip that we‚Äôll forever remember and treasure, all staff was extremely kind, and overall was 100% worth the almost 24 hour trip to get there. If you‚Äôre considering this hotel just BOOK IT, you won‚Äôt‚Ä¶"
"We have just returned from our third trip to SSL and it just keeps getting better! For context, we have also been to 5 other resorts in the Maldives. We stayed in Ocean Beach Pool Villa 95, which is our favourite in that category and IMO the nicest single room villa on the island. The room design is superb and 95 has a lovely large partly shady garden/pool area with direct views from the room across the pool down the wide path to the beach and out to sea. We were beautifully looked after by our wonderful GEM (butler) Abdulla, as on our previous 2 visits. He ensured that we had everything we wanted at all times without being the least intrusive  - and so kind, gentle and friendly.  Our room was immaculately serviced on our return from every breakfast and dinner, a big thank you‚Ä¶"
"We had an amazing time in Laamu - the plsce is beautiful - the house reef easily accessible with kids with loads of turtles, sharks and rays. Food was also amazing especially the food market nights. The hotel has a great marine biology center - thank you Miri for showing us around and explaining the underwater world to us snd our kids. The best thing about Six Senses Laamu is the outstanding staff  there- our GEM Shah did everything in his powers to make our stay unforgettable.

"How to start ?! I went to Six Senses Lammu with my husband to spend our honeymoon on August 23. We defitenely couldn‚Äôt choose any other place. We always dreamed about going to Maldives, but the barefoot luxury style of Six Senses, was what caught our attention the most. It was such a long journey for us to arrive at the island, but as soon as we arrived, we felt at home.  To begin, I would like to start talking about the service. The attention and kindness we received during our stay, we have never experienced in any other hotel in the world. We felt so special and being cared of all the time.

Our ‚Äòguest experience maker‚Äô Shah was simply the best - so helpful, so friendly and full of great suggestions. I loved the sustainability tour where I was shown the hotel‚Äôs eco credentials. Would definitely recommend to other honeymooners! "
What a very special place! We originally went to celebrate my 50th birthday but then decided to renew our wedding vows on the beach.  The organisation before you even set foot on the boat is reassuring. Every question is answered in a timely manner.   You feel very well looked after from the moment you leave the plane. We spoke to another family who had been the previous year so that reassured us even more that this place was worth going back to. When you arrive on the island everything is taken care of. Our GEM Shihan was so helpful and very hard working. This is something that you see through out the whole island-their desire to make yours and their environment pleasurable. They think before you even ask..... as if by magic.  Our wedding on the beach was such fun and organised‚Ä¶
"I stayed in Laamu with my daughter at the beginning of August as a special treat for her graduation. What an incredible time we had, Laamu is just magical.  We were greeted by the most wonderful, friendly people on our arrival. Our host Afrah was so charming and looked after us so well. We stayed in a beach villa with a pool which was super comfortable. We woke every morning to  the most glorious view.  Breakfast was just spectacular and with very much look forward to that lights on offer every morning. Is the whole day was full with diving massages or just relaxing by the pool. We tried all the restaurants and very hard to decide on our favourite, the Asian buffet was possibly a highlight as the food on offer was quite outstanding. Each meal was like eating in a Michelin star‚Ä¶"
"A magical and beautiful island, amazing sea-life, superb service and great food.  And that‚Äôs not to mention our utterly superb Guest Experience Maker (GEM), Shah, who was himself a gem.  We now need a new excuse to repeat this idyllic honeymoon experience"
"I'm not really sure where to start. I could simply write ""perfect"" and that would cover it.  From the moment we arrived at Mal√© we were greeted by Six Senses staff who immediately took care of everything. A short wait in the domestic terminal, a short flight to another island then a Six Senses speedboat ride and we arrived at the resort.  The welcome was amazing and so personal. Our daughter was greeted by name as we stepped off the boat. We were introduced to staff and lastly to our GEM (Guest Experience Maker), Masthooq.   Masthooq deserves special mention as being the most superb butler. Throughout our stay he took care of everything. Polite, personable, friendly and extremely helpful.

The resort is very involved in sustainability and in taking care of the planet and its marine life. Coco told us everything about the resort‚Äôs initiatives, as well as taught us about the reef‚Äôs fauna during the snorkelling activity. 100% recommended!

"Our family's experience at Six Senses Laamu was fantastic!  Every single staff member was excellent, especially Shah, our GEM, who was always aware of every single one of us, took care of all the details and made our trip more comfortable and splendid.  The food at the resort was amazing. Every meal is covered with many food variations, and there are several restaurants in which clients can have mouth-watering meals. There is even an area where free ice cream is offered during the day and provides more than 45 different flavors! Thanks to Abidha for being so kind and suggesting the different tasty options that were shown! It is also amazing how Six Senses Laamu has an enormous interest in taking care of the planet.

"After being travelling for a couple of weeks accross Asia we terminated our HoneyMoon in Six Senses Maldives and it has been insuperable. All the facilities, stuff, restaurants and surroundings are incredible and perfect to disconnect and recharge batteries. Thank you to our GEM - Abdulla - for taking care of us during these days and making sure that we enjoy at maximum. We highly recommend the hotel üëç "
"Overall, an excellent experience way way beyond our expectations.  What we loved‚Ä¶(in no ranking order) - the welcome by the dolphins as we approached the island‚Ä¶a little luck surely‚Ä¶but how magical - the whole team! Professional in what they do, yet always personalised, taking time to engage in conversation with guests, making us feel right at ‚Äòhome‚Äô. - our Gem Ath har, absolutely our ‚ÄòBestie‚Äô. Besides ensuring all things were well organised, and finding solutions to all our requests, he thought of all the little details that made the difference to the experience. - the attention to detail is also impressive in all the services throughout the whole stay. Nothing is missed‚Ä¶rooms cleaned when we were at breakfast, your favourite fruits noted at breakfast and prepared, bicycles‚Ä¶"
"Extraordinary experience. We stayed at Water Villa with Pool, and I highly recommend it. Interior Design is amazing, Bose sound system with subwoofer enhance experience and the view from bed is simply one of the most inspiring ever.  Water temperature of the pool and ocean at exact point (not too cold a not too hot - just perfect). Many interesting activities and it‚Äôs hard to pick the best.  Picnic at a private island is an experience of a lifetime. All the staff is very well trained and focused on the guest. It is worth to flag that GEM Abdulla represents this guest centric mindset. Always available and suggesting activities aligned with our interests. "
"We had a truly magical holiday experience. The resort occupies a lush tropical island surrounded by turquoise water teeming with marine life. We enjoyed scuba diving, stand-up paddle boarding, kayaking, lounging by the beautiful pool and snorkelling the house reef and the seagrass meadows. Turtles and rays were plentiful, along with beautiful corals and dense clouds of tropical fish. A highlight was our son's sighting of three manta rays during a scuba dive - what a lifelong precious memory! We loved our personalised bicycles, the turtles surfacing in the lagoon near our villa every afternoon, the gorgeous food and our 'guest experience manager' who sorted everything out for us. One of us needed gluten free food due to coeliac disease, and this was managed smoothly, discretely‚Ä¶"
"It‚Äôs hard to find enough superlatives to describe the fabulous experience we had at Six Senses Laamu. The ocean villa was simply incredible - both in its location and comfort. We loved the de-facto island mode of transport i.e., bicycle and we fully embraced the barefoot living.  The food selection and quality were outstanding and this aspect was enhanced by the fantastic F&B customer service. Friendly, enthusiastic, and timely every single time. All of the staff were excellent but a special mention in our case to Fariz and Warren. The Spa experience was second to none, the gym was a delight and the free and delicious homemade ice-cream the ultimate crowd pleaser The snorkelling is excellent on the house reef ‚Äì we saw turtles, reef sharks and rays every day - and just slightly‚Ä¶"
"Amazing surfing trip with the best coral reef to snorkel, also amazing water villa with the best food. White beach with beautiful sunset make our trip perfect. We will visit here again as soon as possible"
"My mother got injured before we arrived on the island, and Tanny and the manager helped us arrange a doctor. Tanny provided full assistance, even escorting us to and from our room. The doctor even brought a crutch for my mother the next day‚Äîsuch thoughtful service! The food on the island is unparalleled. We booked the half-board option, which includes dinner, and every meal was of superb quality, with fresh and delicious ingredients. The daily breakfast had an a la carte menu, and my favorite was the eggs Benedict. At 11 AM, we could go to the diving center with a coach for free snorkeling. I met a super handsome instructor, and I'm grateful for the experience. Overall, Tanny is the best butler!"
"Amazing beach and sea! Our GEM Tanny is very friendly and responsible. She had helped us settle almost every activities while we were in resort and the airport transfer, we are glad to have her as our GEM. And we saw the stars and dolphins!!!!!"
"this review comes with a bit of delay as we visited SSL back in march of this year, and i am just now coming around to writing it. we are seasoned maldives travelers having visited upwards of 25 properties (mostly in the 5*+ segment), and this year we decided to make a return to six senses laamu, just 12 months after our initial visit. this is a pretty big deal for us as this is the first time we have actually planned to revisit a resort in the maldives (with so many properties it sometimes feels like a waste to re visit places). i think speaks volumes about how special six senses laamu is. after visiting a second time i am happy to report that SSL was just as amazing as it was the first time around!   i wrote an pretty exhaustive review on six senses last year (feel free to‚Ä¶"
"Great experience, a perfect combination of nature, hospitality and a great resort. The dolphins which swim by the resort in morning and afternoon more than make up for the distance from Male and the fact that you need a Maldivian airplane to the nearest airport to get the resort. Food was excellent, Spa was fantastic, the snorkeling and diving activities were truly spectacular. Driving bikes gave a special feeling and free ice cream all day long was icing on the cake. Our GEM, Ameen went out of the way to make it spectacular stay for us. "
"We enjoyed beautiful scenery, delicious food, and various activities. The food was delicious at all 4 restaurants. The room was spacious and I had a relaxing time.  Our GEM  Aslah was very kind and helped us even though we didn't speak English. Thank you for the best honeymoon!  Arisa"
It was a very nice hotel. The food was delicious and the butlers were courteous and friendly. The view is great and the villas are nicely designed. Everything was great. We will never be able to experience anything like this again. It was the best week of my life.
"Our honeymoon trip starts here. Six Senses proved itself IHG guaranteed quality and natural Maldivian feelings. Our hosts are warm-hearted, especially our GEM Ms.Tanny helps us schedule our 4 days very well. Laamu Atoll has beloved fantastic scenery above and underwater, we have seen 6 turtles, 3 baby sharks as well as some rays here. Private island picnic and Finding Nemo tour are impressive.

If you are a diver or just snorkling you van see so many it amazed us again and again.  The staff is super friendly and our Gem Gabi made our second time even better than the first time.  We dove and saw a big group of Mobular Ray‚Äôs that was zo amazing.we where lucky that Martyne was joining our dive and made beautiful pictures and movies that are going to be used in the Laamu‚Äôs marine biology center the Shell , where kids and adults in all ages can learn everything what‚Äôs around in the beautiful  ocean.

"We arrived to Six Senses after staying 7 nights at Vakkaru, followed by Halaveli .  We loved our stay but I have to mention certain aspects of it to raise awareness of the senior management.  Having paid similar rates at all 3 resorts this holiday ( vakkaru , Six Senses and Halaveli) I must say Vakkaru tops the experience in term of luxury and service. (Halaveli was a bit of a let down this time) I have to say we are regular travellers to the Maldives and this was our 3rd visit this year and over 20 resorts so far including one and only, Four Seasons ,Ozen , Gili, all Anantara islands together with Niyama etc .  We had a surprise upgrade to Sunset Laamu water villas which was very welcome as building work was happening throughout our stay on Jetty A !!! This limited use of bikes‚Ä¶"
"Lovely relaxing holiday with great food and friendly staff. We spent 8 nights with our two kids in two Laamu overwater bungalows. Bungalows are spacious with lovely views and nice outdoor shower/bath. We stayed on Jetty C which is furthest away from centre of resort . You can either have sunset view or sunrise. Sunrise gives you uninterrupted view of the lagoon and ocean while sunset you see other jetty. Food is amazing, loads of choice, restaurants etc. we loved lobster dinner on beach and the buffets especially. House reef snorkelling was great and the coral looks in decent shape and we saw loads of fish and turtles. We did the dolphin cruise but didn‚Äôt see any dolphins so our GEM Aslah gave us a complementary second cruise and we saw loads that time, spinning and splashing‚Ä¶"
"We have an amazing time in Six Senses Laamu! The hotel is perfect to spend some days with the family enjoying and chilling! The hotel is so beautiful and confortable. The staff are friendly and kindly, for sure they improved our time there!  We loved our experience of doing the wine dinner and the wine challenge! We could surf good waves with the guys of Tropic surf! Pablo, our GEM, helped us to have the best time in the Island. It was a pleasure have him as our GEM! We hope come back very soon!"
"We stayed for a week in Six Senses Laamu during our honeymoon. The hotel manages to offer all the comfort of an extremely luxurious hotel and at the same time being integrated in complete harmony with the nature that surrounds it. The food, rooms, spa and above all the level of the service of the staff were amazing. Pablo, who was our GEM during our stay, took care of absolutely everything and made us feel at home.  In a place where nature is the most beautiful  and important attraction, the hotel offers you the resources to understand the ecosystem that it is around it. The hub for environmental initiatives offers knowledge and lessons about that amazing place.  We hope to come back in the near future."
"Phenomenal first experience with Six Senses Laamu! Couples relax trip. Second visit to the Maldives. We chose this island resort for the romantic aspect and house reef to snorkel. We have stayed in a OWB before so chose an ocean beach villa and it exceeded our expectations. No need to even leave our room as the pool was lovely, our own hammock and beach lounge chairs!  Many thanks to our GEM, Tanny who made our stay wonderful. She was great at letting us know what daily activities were available and making dinner reservations. Bakka was our room attendant and also fantastic preparing our room each day and night. We are most appreciative of all the staff. The bar staff at Sip Sip were also amazing and work so hard!   The highlights: So much greenery and lushness around the‚Ä¶"
"What an amazing place! There are many resorts one can go to for a generic experience, but if you‚Äôre looking for something special then this is it. Our entire stay was fabulous. From the airport pickup, to the boat ride in, to the personal welcome by the general manger and the whole team, the sensational food and excellent service by the staff, everything was top notch. Our Guest Experience Manager (GEM) Ameen was fantastic and super-organised and made our trip truly memorable. The villa we stayed in was immaculately kept. The team at the dive centre (especially Khush and Izaz) were superb teachers and helped us log our first scuba dives. Not only were we able to relax in the great facilities, we also learnt about the local conservation and sustainability work by the amazing‚Ä¶"
" Since the very first moment here, it feels like you‚Äôre part of one big family.   Our GEM, Aslah, took amazing care of us during the whole time. Always ensuring our stay was special and easy.   Every day has been unique thanks to each of the people we met; Starting with Aslah meeting us in the morning, having an animal-shaped pancake for breakfast made by a talented artist, meeting Siham at the pool bar with his friendliness and his handmade palm leaf figures, and having delicious desserts and icecream from the hand of the generous and friendly chef in charge of those, and coming back to a cozy room done by our sweet housekeeping man.   At all times I have received from all the staff kind and real smiles, and a warm and exceptional treatment. All this positive energy is‚Ä¶"
"This was honestly the most amazing experience! The staff and the resort itself was incredible and everyone was so so kind to my family and I. The water sports were so fun, the food is delicious and overall, we couldn‚Äôt have asked for a more perfect holiday with such amazing people! We are beyond grateful to the six senses staff for this fantastic holiday. "
"We had the most wonderful stay at the Six Senses. The staff, location and rooms are out of this world! Our gem, Aslah, went above and beyond the call of duty. Nothing was too much trouble for him and he helped make our stay amazing. "
"This is truly one of the best resorts you can stay at, not just in the Maldives but globally. Our GEM Aslah really made our stay so special and did everything with a genuine smile and kindness that really resonated well with the fundamentals that make the resort so special . Also a special mention to Siham at the pool, whose gentle and kind nature made for some truly incredible interactions and service. All the staff here are so genuine and truly embody authentic hospitality. I can‚Äôt recommend anywhere better to stay ! Truely a remarkable experience!"
This is our 3rd time back at Six Senses Laamu  ...just incredible on so many levels ...a special shout out to Aslah who looked after us in just the most sincere way ... we loved our stay . The picnic to the private island is a must 
"Six Senses Laamu has it all.  The island is beautiful: palm fringed, white sand beaches surrounded by turquoise waters and lush tropical vegetation.  The team are so welcoming, friendly, and helpful and make you feel at home instantly.  The coral and marine life is the best I‚Äôve encountered in the Maldives having visited repeatedly over thirty years. The barefoot luxury approach embraces the Six Senses commitment to sustainability, wellness, and design.   This was our third visit to SSL.  We didn‚Äôt think it was possible to improve on our prior ‚Äòperfect visits‚Äô, but these last two weeks were the best yet!  I‚Äôm not sure how Marteyne (GM) does it, but she has a fantastic team.  On arrival our wonderful GEM, Afrah, greeted us and whisked us away to our villas so efficiently. ‚Ä¶"
"The sustainability concept for a luxury holiday is commendable, we enjoyed it greatly and responsibly. Our GEM ameen was an absolute gem he sorted out our itinerary and his recommendations were always spot on.  Several activities are available for everyone and the Maldivian hospitality was amazing"
"The resort is perfect on every level. Finishing of the villas, restaurants, foods & service was outstanding. Absolute paradise. The whole experience was out of this world. My daughter specially loved the kids club & they were brilliant with her. Delighted with the care & affection of the entire team. Special thank you to our Gem Aslah who was extremely attentive when we needed help. our holidays with the best memories in paradiseüôè"
"Great hotel, great staff, great dive center and instructors The restaurant are also great, the food delicious and high standard The general athmosphere made us very happy and we would be delighted to come back!! "
Everything was amazing! The level of details for everything is perfect.  Our GEM Aslah made our planning and we managed to do a lot of activities! We also dived with Khuch and the underwater nature is incredible!
"  This resort must be the best one in the Maldives. I will strongly recommend this island if you love sea creatures and a well-preserved marine environment. You do not need to get on a boat to see schools of fish, sea turtles, and sharks (but if you want to, there are those activities as well). What you need is just a set of equipment for snorkeling, and you can discover all sorts of marine life around the island.    Also, the food here is unbelievable. Apart from the numerous delicious cuisines cooked from fresh raw materials captured from the sea, there are  plenty of vegetarian options as well. The ice cream in the resort is one of the best I've ever tasted.   I do not need to say much about the service, as you can see the high score for this resort by yourself. But I do,‚Ä¶"
"Amazing place, we been here 3 times and will go back. Beautiful and amazing setting, the staff is the small difference - everything is possible and they understand custermer service and live it as a team. A mix of local and foreign staff all working as one unit giving a little something special out about them selves - always with a smile!  Best ice cream in the world and nice people, Rena the incredible sweet man and the local lady as well - allways serving and smiling! The surf team made the days for our kid, just fantastic young people, so nice ‚Ä¶ just more than a vacationsplace! A special thanks to our gem, Aslah that just understands people‚Äôs need and can make things happend in the right way, always easy for him!

"Absolutely fantastic experience again in Six Senses Laamu. Everything and everyone are  incredible, and the service experience is second to none. Especially our GEM Aslah made everything work smooth and easy. And of course the absolute amazing surroundings and water takes your breath away."
"Nice view and very nice guys here! Especially thanks for my GEM, Ashlah ,he did a great help and assists to us in these days. We really get a memorable experience here , it‚Äôs very worth to come here with your family and friends! It also have a good dishes here, I can‚Äôt wait to come here again!"
"It was a daydream in the Maldives for our honey moon!  And Six Senses was the portal to live the integration with nature. Being barefoot for 7 days, riding a bike everywhere and staying in a Villa above the sea was really, really special.  And what a Villa! You can stay in the room all day everyday and it would be fantastic!!!  Really comfortable and at the same time rustic. You discover day by day all the secret pleasures.  But I need to highlight the private island experience. A MUST! I feel that nothing in life is going to beat this! Being 6 hours in our own in a private paradise with a gourmet menu qwas unique! The island is a dream come true!   The staff is a highlight too.  They do everything to please us.   Our GEM, Shihan, made the difference! Best tips and advices, best‚Ä¶"
"Amazing place and atmosphere. All kinds of activities and great staff. Special mention to Pablo, our Guest Experience Maker who took good care of our time at Six Senses. Food is amazing and you have different options to choose from."
"If you want a Maldivian destination that has it all this is it.  From sustainable presentations, naming mantas to world class diving and insane surfing, it‚Äôs a holiday for all the family.  Run by the heart of the hotel Marteyne, the resort oozes luxury in a casual relaxed manner.  Special mention to the dive crew including Izzy and Judith who made sure all dives were fantastic and a special thanks goes out to the whole of the Tropic surf school who‚Äôs patience and tuition turned us in to to semi surfing gurus in a matter of days‚Ä¶thanks Jimmy, Monty and all for a brilliant time.  Last but not least, Masthooq made our trip amazing by looking after us at all times‚Ä¶big thank you to the owner of the Nintendo docking station!!!!"
"Six Senses Laamu delivers all you expect and more!  The Villas is something out of this world - amazing view, incredible outside area with pool, sunbeds, table and a lounge area under the shade. The bathroom is also basically outdoors and the bathtub in transparent for you to see the ocean underneath. Sleeping to the sound of the tides and waking up with the birds for an ocean dive in the transparent blue waters is just like waking up from a dream.   The hotel has a suggested policy of no shoes, so from the day we got there until the day we left, we didn‚Äôt wear any shoes - not for breakfast, lunch, dinner or for any other activities. This made us feel at home and completely integrated with the island lifestyle. Also, you get to move around the island on your own bike, which‚Ä¶"
"Short and sweet: The best trip of our lives. The resort, food and staff were extraordinary. If you're the kind of traveler who likes understated luxury, look no further.   More backstory: The Maldives has always been on my bucket list, and I thought it would be the perfect special trip to celebrate our 30th anniversary. Our travel agent knows that we enjoy ""barefoot luxury"" and she recommended Six Senses Laamu (SSL). Between my dreaming of the Maldives for decades, the time and expense involved getting there, and the fact that my wife really doesn't like long flights, expectations and demands were about as high as they could be. Not only did SSL meet them, they blew them all away.  We've traveled a lot and I'm not exaggerating when I say that our time at SSL was the best‚Ä¶"
IT IS the most beautiful an amazing resorts I have seen‚Ä¶The staff team and the service also the place was excellent very clean specially the insects what maldevis famous with..we really enjoyed and it‚Äôs my recommendation for everyone looking for something special clean and have entertainment..Thanks for Six senses
"The Six Senses Laamu is exceptional to whom looking for incredible vacation and relaxation. Surrounding reef and coral, very helpful and cooperative staff, clean & high end accommodations, restaurants and other support facilities. It was one of my best destinations. I will repeat the visit Staff never hesitate to help any time with smile faces"
"Really really appreciated Six Sense‚Äôs sustainable development strategies, including paperless, supporting and educating local fishermen as well as running ocean project.   Another great thanks for every staff‚Äôs above and beyond services, esp SM Tan and GEM Thohir. They well planned our itinerary before our arrival. During our stay, they always listen my needs and wants, and then try their best to make it happen. Even I check out already, Thohir still showed his hospitality to us. When he found manta and shark, he told us immediately. Let our check list ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ  For diving experience, I highly recommend Tiby for beginners.

I surprised my bride with this trip for our honeymoon. From the time I made contact with the amazing staff at Six Senses Laamu I knew I had made the right decision for the  destination for our honeymoon. After a little research the flights through Singapore was the way to go from Australian.  We were welcomed at the airports and taken on a short speed boat ride to the island. Amazing views and experience.   On arrival we were greeted by what seemed like the whole staff. Smiling faces and genuine warmth. We met our GEM (guest experience manager) there also. His name is SOBA. He not only deserves a pay rise but also an award of some delightful description.   After a briefing and introduction to the staff We hopped onto a buggy and taken to our rooms. To say it was like a postcard‚Ä¶

"Each year for our wedding anniversary, my wife and I pick a location to celebrate as we mark places off of our bucket list.  For our 20th we certainly wanted it to be special and Six Senses Laamu ended up being our favorite so far out of our other 21 adventures including our Honeymoon.  We've traveled for our wedding anniversary and many other occasions as well, I feel qualified to say that Six Senses easily gets 5 star from me.  Our travel began in the states as we flew Qatar and connected into through Doha.  Qatar was excellent and if you can swing the Q Suites they will make certainly make the travel easier, also the lounge in Doha is phenomenal.    By the time we reached Male we were worn out and and ready to arrive, I will admit the waiting at the domestic airport and‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses Laamu is as close as it gets to heaven on earth. The resort is absolutely beautiful with every amenity one could need and a friendly and well trained staff to back. I have never stayed at a resort that pays so much attention to the simplest details to ensure that their guest have the best experience. Our GEM (Guest Experience Maker) Aslah was incredible at ensuring that our time at Six Senses was well spent and enjoyable. This trip was magical! Everything from the beautifully designed villas, to the world class menu  was impeccable. What truly sets Six Senses Laamu apart for me the most though are the people.

We had our honeymoon at the Six Senses Laamu and it was the best experience of our lives. Our GEM Soba went above and beyond to make sure we had an unforgettable trip. But I also want to highlight how amazing every single member of staff was. We want to especially thank the staff at the Chill Bar who took great care of us during our many lunches there. The food throughout the whole hotel was a 10/10. And the experiences and activities are unparalleled.  Most beautiful place on earth! 
"This was our 6th time in the Maldives, so our expectations were high. Were they met? Yes! And exceeded in many aspects. Lagoon villa in jetty C was private and with good views. Food was consistently good in all restaurants, I liked Leaf a lot but also found the buffet nights really good, (best risotto ever). I did try diving for the first time, and felt very safe the whole time, it was an amazing experience. The house reef was incredible, we didn‚Äôt get tired of snorkeling every day. I‚Äôve never seen such a variety of marine life while snorkeling: sharks, turtles, barracudas, napoleon and many others. They give you a bicycle that comes with a wooden plate with your initials, a charming detail, we biked back and forth the whole week from our villa to the common areas and enjoyed it‚Ä¶"
"There are no words to describe this experience. It was absolutely amazing! Service quality, facilities, culinary, employees (especially Amsood, our GEM, thanks again so much for making such an unforgettable experience for us! We still talk about you and what an amazing, professional and fun personality you are!) as well as management (thanks a lot Patrick & team!), just everything is perfection. We felt so well looked after and honestly, everyone read our wishes before we could even articulate them. I celebrated my birthday there and was surprised with loads little things, thanks so much for this! Generally, I did the I dive you spa package, and ended up pretty much doing everything on my own due to my husband's ear problems (hence couldn't go diving), what I've experienced‚Ä¶"
Our experience has been incredible. The place is unique and the closest thing to paradise. Our GEM PABLO has been very attentive and helpful. He has made our stay very easy and comfortable. The food is great and the service is wonderful. The best hotel in maldivas.
"Our experience in Six Senses overcome our expectations.  The Resort is amazing. Not only because of the Resort itself, but also because all the staff works to make  the stay an unfforgatble experience. Since we arrived until we leave Six Senses provided us an unique guest experience. Our GEM , Abdulla, was absolutly fantastic. He made our experience much better, providing us orientation and recomendations during our stay.  Another thing that is fantastic is the Six Senses culture regarding sustainability. The resort promotes a sustainable way of living making their own furniture,  clothes, even water in their own facility. They also promote sustainability by supporting local islands having bussiness with local companies and suppliers. They provide a lot of experiences without‚Ä¶"
"(June 10-15) We had the best 5 days of our lives. The Six Senses experience is unique and indescribable, you can only live it! I would also like to specially mention Pablo, who has made it possible for us to leave with a smile from ear to ear and wanting to come back, thanks to his attention and care.  As for the hotel, the Water Villa are amazing, you have privacy and lots of amenities. Also, the Six Senses has many activities (free and paid) with which, with a good guide like Pablo, you can enjoy the tranquility of Yoga and diving among sharks.  100% recommendable the Six Senses experience! We will come back!  P.d thanks Pablo :) "
"Overall fantastic resort in terms of food, service, facilities. Here, you get the original ""Six Senses experience"" and this is still one of my favorite Six Senses among all Six Senses hotels.

"We have spent 4 days in this amazing Hotel as the last days of our Honeymoon.  To get to the island first we had to take a plane from Male and than a boat took us to the final destination. On the Male airport we could wait for our plane in a nice lounge with AC and a free buffet. The stuff of the hotel was already there helping us with the luggage the check in and everything.  Before the boat trip we have met with our GEM- Guest Experience Manager- Sobah.  When we have arrived to the island the team has welcomed us, we took our shoes down and we have started our amazing journey.   We have enjoyed many of the activities what the hotel had to offer- almost every morning at 11 we have joined the snorkeling tour which was guided by the local marine biologists. We have been diving‚Ä¶"
"Low season with good weather, the perfect combination in the Maldives. Stayed at a wonderful villa at the end of the jetty. Swimming in the pool watching stars at night was great.  But more than anything, we want to highlight a great job our GEM, Shah, did for us. My wife even burst into cry, missing the good memory she had, when leaving the resort. Just to avoid any misunderstanding, other staff were also very attentive. "
"Six Senses Laamu is a Hope Spot in terms of all the good work they do for the ocean life and for me it is my Happy Spot! This was my 7th visit so that and see my previous reviews for more details basically says it all‚Ä¶.. I feel very much at home here with the GREAT team and all the wonderful facilities. Amazing snorkeling, spa and food. I followed a Sleep Progamme with the spa with meditation, pranayama, body balance and lots of great (ayurvedic) treatments, I can recommend this to everyone, it is so good to invest a week in yourself and get back with great new knowledge, skills, memories and overall a big zen feel. A BIG thanks to all of you my friend of Laamu. See you soon!"
"Thanks to GEM Pablo and Six Senses Hotel for hosting us on our honeymoon.  We had an amazing time.  We will never forget this magnificent place.  Special thanks to our GEM Pablo for making our stay so much easier and more enjoyable and for being so attentive to us at all times, that's a much better way to rest! Thank you very much Pablo for taking such good care of us! He has taken care of us in every possible way, being there for us at all times. He gave us his personal telephone number for anything we needed! In all the activities he was waiting for us at the beginning and at the end. Super nice with the conversations. All in all, thank you six Senses for having such good and friendly staff. Without a doubt the best hotel we have stayed at in the world. We are already planning‚Ä¶"
"Where do I start...from the moment we got off the plane in Male until the day we left on the plane from Male we were looked after in every way possible!   Let's start with the hotel, it was incredible, beautifully maintained and clean. We loved the no shoes policy and its worth embracing. We stayed in beach villa for 9 nights and then 2 nights in a over water villa. We personally probably preferred the beach villa with the children as there was a pool in the room however we cannot fault the water villa. We went for the ocean view water villa which was lovely as we did not overlook any other villas, we looked out only onto the sea.   The food was faultless, really high quality and I don't think we had one meal that didn't feel fresh and delicious. We loved all the restaurants and‚Ä¶"
"The scenery is so beautiful. I'm glad to listen to Tanny's advice to go snorkeling and see a lot of beautiful scenery.  The meal is delicious, and the people here are also very friendly. Thank you for our GEM:Afram, Tanny!"
"When it comes to describing my recent stay at the Six Senses Laamu resort in the Maldives, it's hard not to sound overly enthusiastic. But to be honest, this place genuinely blew me away with its exceptional service, amenities, and overall experience.  Right from the start, the staff were attentive and caring. I felt welcomed and well-taken care of throughout my stay, which is a testament to their commitment to guest satisfaction.  The facilities at the resort were top-notch. The 2-bedroom villa I stayed in was not just comfortable, but it had an amazing view. Waking up every morning to the sight of the beautiful Indian Ocean was truly something else. Not to mention, the spa was great. Whether you're into wellness or just need a good relaxing session, you won't be disappointed. ‚Ä¶"
I cannot believe that this resort could be considered a hotel of the year  the resort feels a bit tired  the food offer disappoints .............breakfast especially is farcical ; there is a huge offering but spread out ...........I do not do stairs and tired of queueing and long walks many times up to first floor carrying my food  the spa is fabulous  the people /staff are kind and obliging   we paid a huge amount of money for our stay and felt the place is overrated and over priced    the transfer from male airport to laamu was unwelcome ; staff are obliging but did not appreciate paying ¬£1000 to make a ransfer on a scheduled 50 seater plane............we wasted lots of time making transfers in total eight hours (4 hours each way )after a 11hour flight   we have stayed at‚Ä¶
"My wife and I decided to come here to spend our honey moon. This place is like Heaven on Earth!  The transportation to get to the hotel is well arranged. When you arrive to the hotel, you are asigned with a GEM (in our case was Shihan who did an extraorfinary work) that takes care of all your needs during your stay as well as arranging the different activities the hotel has and the reservations for the restaurants.  Finally, the food is from another world. Some of the courses we have tasted can easily be a Michelin restaurant dish.  If you want to have the best experience in the world, definetely this is the place.  We will repeat for sure."
"This was our second visit to Six Senses Laamu, and right away we were treated as if we were coming back home! The place, activities and service were flawless as we remembered them, while at the same time there were additions and changes that kept the experience fresh.  Thank you GEM Shah for taking care of us so well, and to all the staff at the Spa for pampering me so beautifully! Not forgetting also Abbie and Rana‚Äôs sweet treats and sunny dispositions that always make me smile. Also thank you to the conservation team (Amy, Greg, Jenny) for everything you did for us and the environment in Laamu."
"Six Senses Laamu is my favourite beach resort in world.  Second visit was even better than the first. Incredible resort which if I could I would just live there. The food - always good no matter what you order, great way to try new things too as it always good Service is excellent - you really feel like nothing is too much, and the staff genuinely takes care of you to make sure you are happy The resort itself is stunningly beautiful, and there‚Äôs never a shortage of things to do (I almost had to make myself stop and relax!) Most incredible of all is the way the resort mixes environmental conservation and hospitality is A-MA-ZING - here you have a beautiful maldivian resort with everything you could wish for, but that genuinely cares for its environment and goes well above and‚Ä¶"
"The above water experience was without parallel: our over water bungalow with full ocean view was restorative, 5 unique restaurants with fresh, sustainable ingredients delicious, and our own cruiser bikes to ride through the jungle on sandy paths delightful.  We deeply relaxed and loved how our GEM took excellent care of us, and the warmth and friendliness of the entire staff was inspiring.   Diving was a treat: exquisite reefs, excellent dive masters and boat crew, who served us hot tea on the boat after we surfaced elated from our time with Manta Rays, octopus, schools of fish, soft coral, sharks, and spotted eagle rays.  We also loved the Shell research and education center where we became better connected with the incredible Indian Ocean environment and the state-of-the-art‚Ä¶"
"I come back for the second time in this slice of paradise and i m leaving with my heart full of happiness! The experience at Six Seses Laamu it‚Äôs a total bliss. The environment it‚Äôs dreamy every single details is made with love for us to enjoy the experience. Everyone is truly kind,  welcoming and very sweet. A special mention for our GEM, Shah, who made all the experience beautiful to the next level!! He looked after us like nobody and he made all our wishes and dream come to life!! He‚Äôs completely passionate with his work, and with all the kindness is always there for us to helps us, to welcome us in every moment and to enhance our enjoyment in this beautiful island!  Thank you Shah, it‚Äôs such a great pleasure to meeting you! You made our stay memorable!"
"We have just returned from a 2 week stay in Six Senses Laamu and despite the jet lag I‚Äôm still buzzing from the experience. Before we went I read loads of the reviews and wondered was this place really as good as people were saying, and I can honestly say yes‚Ä¶.and some! This was our first experience of the Maldives and it certainly won‚Äôt be the last. The resort and island is superb, the rustic and charming buildings and villas give the impression of simplicity however with all the requirements that you need for a luxurious experience. We took the sustainability tour which was a bit of an eye opener as it demonstrated the enormous work and dedication that goes on behind the scene to ensure that the guests and hosts have the best time. As previous people have commented about how‚Ä¶"
"This is the second time we've been there. the place is heavenly, the staff extremely kind. a big thank you to Shah for his support and to the surf team. the food is excellent and the different restaurants are all beautiful. fabulous!"
"We just returned from 10 days in paradise at Six Senses Laamu.  The experience was top tier from the moment we arrived to the moment we left.  The resort is beautiful, both the nature and the accommodation, and is impeccably run.  We stayed in a sunset villa, which was over water with a view of the fish even from the loo.  The food was among the best we have enjoyed in any holiday destination.  It was both delicious and well presented by delightful staff.  The activities were plentiful, well designed and smoothly executed. Our favorites were the reef snorkeling and the sunset dolphin cruse on which we got to see a playful pod of spinners. We also appreciated the eco friendly approach and the knowledgeable team of marine biologists (apparently the largest in the Maldives) who‚Ä¶"
"The days my husband and I were in six senses resort were definitely the highlight of our Maldives honeymoon trip. Everything was so amazing and I really like how six senses resort creates a such wonderful and comfortable place and is so eco-friendly at the same time. We want to especially thank our GEM Sobah, who was very considerate and helpful! We are looking forward to bringing our kids there next time! :D"
"If you go to Maldives, this is the place to go. ""Delicious food, beautiful sea, kind staff, you can forget about your daily life and relax."" ""I'm Japanese and can only speak a little English, but the friendly staff was kind enough to communicate with me."""
"We visited Six Senses Laamu for our honeymoon and I honestly cannot think of anything that could have improved our experience. This is the perfect paradise for anyone that appreciates both luxury and sustainability.   We loved the bare-foot rustic charm, the amazing food options, the friendliness of every staff member and all the extra touches that made us feel so welcome. I haven‚Äôt been to the Maldives before so I have nothing to compare to, but In conversation with other guests, several of them said that they have previously been to other Maldives resorts but that Six Senses is the only one they will now return to‚Ä¶ which I think says it all. I think I would be worried to try anywhere else in case it‚Äôs not as good as this beautiful place.   There‚Äôs a real sense of‚Ä¶"
"When picking a destination for our honeymoon we considered many options. With the guidance of our great travel agent we settled on Six Senses resort on Laamu island in the Maldives. Wedding plans and details for the big day often overshadow the honeymoon, but in this case we were so ready to jet off the day after our wedding, with high expectations and anticipation due to the amazing reviews we had read.  Let me just say that everyone of our expectations were met and then some. The island itself and the ethos created by six senses (bare feet luxury) where guests are asked to consider not wearing shoes to any of the facilities, was simply brilliant and genius in its simplicity. Immediately making one feel relaxed and ready for a holiday. The staff were lovely in their welcome and‚Ä¶"
"We stayed at six senses laamu from 1st to 7th may. arrived at the resort we were greeted by all the staff, then a personal GEM (guest experience maker) will take care of you throughout your vacation. I thank once again mr Ath-har for his professionalism, sympathy and promptness in making our holiday truly unique.  Exceptional restaurants, everything really perfect. The sea bungalow (on the jetty B) was comfortable and clean, the restaurants wonderful, with really exceptional quality.   It was hard to leave, we will definitely be back."
"Having been to the Six Senses in Oman previously, our expectations for Six Senses Laamu were sky high.  After an eight stay, I can easily say that this resort exceeded my expectations!!!  The setting is insanely beautiful, otherwordly and remote.  A true slice of paradise unlike anywhere else I have been.  The standard of service was extraordinary too!  Our ""experience maker"" Shah was continually proactive about ensuring we were making the most of each day.  When I asked to see the doctor for medication, I swear I was seated with the doctor in less than ten minutes!  He always went above and beyond, even filling out our departure forms for us!  And the food is simply incredible!  Very hard to leave this special place..."
"We‚Äôre newlyweds on our honeymoon so we‚Äôd probably be happy anywhere, but let me tell you this was the BEST vacation either of us has ever had. The area is magnificent, the food is delicious, and the service is unparalleled. Loved also the ethos of sustainability and conservation, really made our trip extra special to learn from the marine biologists and local experts. Special shout out to our excellent GEM Pablo who did everything possible to make this the most restful and rewarding trip. Will also be writing a review for the on-site dive shop Deep Blue Divers who were responsible for the most incredible scuba experiences of my life. If you‚Äôre on the fence about where to go, you absolutely cannot go wrong with Six Senses Laamu."
"My wife, two daughters (9 and 13) and I spent a week at the Six Senses Laamu for spring break.  Our vacation was more than we could have imagined.  The resort feels like Paradise. We stayed in a family beach villa which was spacious and luxurious, with its own pool and private beach access. Our GEM Masthooq took amazing care of us and was a joy to get to know.  Overall, the entire resort staff was friendly, attentive, knowledgeable, and the customer service here is next level.    The views from the restaurants are beautiful and we often saw dolphins passing by.  The waters are crystal clear and teaming with life. Snorkeling on the house reefs is stunning and the guided tours led by the marine biologists were a lot of fun.  We saw tons of schooling fish, turtles, rays, and even‚Ä¶"
"Went with my dad on a surf trip after graduating high school! Every aspect of the trip was 10/10: The location / island with all its beauty and wildlife, the surf and all the different activities, the food was amazing, the huts were amazing, and most importantly every person on the staff was genuinely one of the nicest people I have ever met; They all cared so much for our happiness and did everything they could to ensure we had the best possible time! I was fascinated and impressed by the simplicity and kindness of their culture out there. I have been blessed to travel to many different countries around the world and this was certainly the best trip I have ever been on! "
"One of the best properties I have ever visited, It was so special! The staff were amazing, especially our GEM Abdulla! Food was great, rooms were lovely, had one of the best spa experiences to date and just all round incredible vibes. Thank you to everyone that made our trip so wonderful, I now understand why so many people return to this property year after year! I would highly recommend going - you won‚Äôt be disappointed."
"This place is great: the food, the drinks, the service. I'm willing to fly anywhere to see for myself :) This is a perfect spot for lunch with family and friends. Great team thank you all of them. We'll miss you. "
"This place was heaven. The Ethos of Six Sense comes through with everything they've built, how they run it and the amazing team that look after you. Everyone is so friendly, the food is to die for (We ate all vegan and were spoilt by choice by the talented chefs) and the 'no shoes' ethos is just the best, even when it's raining, it feels amazing walking everywhere barefoot.  A GEM (Guest Experience Maker) is designated to you and is there to look after you the whole way. We had Abdulla and he was the best! So friendly and helpful and couldn't do enough for us. He was so knowledgable about everything and so lovely to chat to.  Amir and Warren always looked after us in the restaurants and knew us always by name.  One of the highlights for us was the 'Shell' It's a beautiful‚Ä¶"
"Hotel and location are superb. Full of experiences, with good surf nearby although we didnt get good swells. Snorkelling and diving extremely good. The best are the rooms and the staff, in our case the attention received by Pablo has been differential to our experience. Careful with every detail and always ready to help with great suggestions and never intrusive, one of the gems of the resort."
"My wife and I went as part of our honeymoon and I can truly say it is one of most beautiful places on earth. When you think of quintessential Maldives and tropical paradise, Six Senses embodies all of it. Our overwater villa was stunning, the food was incredible, and we were so well taken care of during our time on the island. We enjoyed spa services, went on 5 incredible dives with their experienced dive guides, and experienced all of the restaurants on the island. We had an amazing host, Afrah, who took great care of us every step of the way and assisted us with all bookings, logistics, and special requests ‚Äî his professionalism and attention to detail were unmatched and we are so appreciative for his kindness and friendship during this most special trip.

"From the time their staff met us at the airport until the time they got us settled in the airport when we left, the staff were TOP NOTCH!  Anything we wanted, was done.  The resort itself was pristine, food was the best we‚Äôve ever had and the beaches and island were literally like a dream.  It was the best vacation we have ever taken and we travel a lot!  Our GEM Ath-har was very attentive and we felt like family from the very beginning.  We cannot wait to go back and bring our family!"
"My husband and I had an amazing experience at Six Senses Laamu. Based on staying at other Six Senses resorts, we didn‚Äôt even look at other options in The Maldives. And, it was pure heaven! They told us it was busier than usual because of Easter vacations, but it never felt like it to us. We rarely saw any other guests on our jetty and the restaurants and other common areas weren‚Äôt that busy. It felt like our own piece of paradise!  We scheduled a number of private experiences for two and we LOVED every single one to include cocktails/sunset on the sand bank, sunken beach table dinner, private outdoor movie theater, wine tasting (blind and so much fun) and massages. But, the one we will never forget was the private island excursion with a gourmet lunch, champagne and wine‚Ä¶"

"Lovely place, excellent treatment, very good restoration. In general, excellent. Totally recommended for couples and for family too. One of the most lovely experience.  If it were closer, ideal to repeat every year."
"We had the most incredible eleven days  in this outstanding hotel. The attention to detail that goes into making it paradise, is evident everywhere you look.  From the stunning, carefully considered and beautifully executed architecture, which nestles sympathetically into the atoll so perfectly, which includes a choice of stunning places to dine, to the consistent consideration given to guests. We were looked after by Gabriel, who made sure we filled our days as much or as little as we wanted, with the variety of activities the hotel has to offer. He was unbelievably helpful and totally charming, incredibly professional and very sensitive to our requirements, whether it be our wish for total peace and privacy or a bit of exploring our surroundings or taking advantage of the‚Ä¶"

"Six Senses Laamu is like stepping into a tropical paradise. We stayed 6 nights at the Family Pool beach villa and 5 nights inside a water villa and I can honestly not say which was better, as both were incredible. Our Gem Gabriel was amazing and took Fantastic care of us, always answering the WhatsApp questions within minutes. He even laughed at my kids stupid jokes, so definitely a great host! For surfing lovers, OMG! We had the BEST time both on Shoulder and also the locations taking a boat. Perfect waves, 5 star quality from Tropical Surf.

"AMAZING!! I would 100% recommend this hotel as the place to be when visiting Maldives.  Facilities are awesome and there is a huge number of activities to do every single day (snorkeling, diving, spa, workshops, fishing, excursions‚Ä¶.) even a cinema under the stars! Rooms are big, nice and comfortable and you can choose among lots of different pillows for your bed. We were in a water villa and it was so comfortable. Shower outside, floor glass at some strategic points of the room to see the seawater and afternoon snack every day in the room.   You have personalized bikes to ride along the facilities and a GEM (Guest experience Manager) who takes care of you during the whole stay. In our case, we had Gabriel and it was top.

"My husband and I have been to more than 15 resorts in the Maldives and Six Senses Laamu was the first one that proudly showed us their sustainability initiatives. I‚Äôd love to see more of these in other resorts. The villa was beautiful with a unique design. Housekeeper Saalim was very friendly and made my birthday more special. There is a wide selection of healthy drinks and food at breakfast. I love the home-made ice cream station with over 40 flavors to choose from. Amsood, our GEM, was professional, friendly and detail-oriented. I enjoyed my massage with Therapist Anil very much. He was highly skilled and courteous. My husband liked GEM Ath-Har, and the girl who prepared fruit in the morning and the girl working at the ice cream counter. It‚Äôs unfortunate we can‚Äôt remember‚Ä¶"
"Dear Six Senses Laamu Team,  I am writing this review to express how much my mom and I enjoyed our recent stay at your resort.   It was truly a wonderful experience from start to finish, and we are grateful for the hard work your staff did to make it a memorable one.  We would especially like to appreciate the attention we received from our GEM Masthooq. He was outstanding in his service and went above and beyond to ensure that we had a comfortable and enjoyable stay.   However, I would like to provide one suggestion.   The waiting time for the domestic flight was quite extensive, and it was difficult to wait for that long. Although we understand that these delays may occasionally occur, we suggest the Six Senses Laamu team try to find a way to address this issue to make the‚Ä¶"

"Our villa is located at the end of Jetty A, offering breathtaking views of the boundless ocean. Although the room may not have been as spacious as other high-end resorts, we enjoyed its rustic and wooden design and the low-key luxury.  The dining experience at Six Senses Laamu were beyond our expectations. We loved the farm-to-table concept and the delectable innovative cuisine; the private BBQ was the most romantic dinner we've ever had, and the deserted island picnic was a true Robinson Crusoe adventure.  A special mention goes to our GEM, Shihan, he took care of every detail, ensuring we didn't miss any of the resort's offerings. His politeness, professionalism, and patience were remarkable, and we are immensely grateful for his exceptional care.  My wife and I had five‚Ä¶"
"We had the most amazing honeymoon at this resort!!! By far, the best part was our guest experience manager, Ashraq! He went above and beyond to make our stay absolutely perfect!  He helped us to plan an itinerary that we loved!  In terms of food, our favorite place ended up being Sip Sip every day for lunch. And the Leaf was the best for dinner. The sommelier was great too. We had wonderful massages and enjoyed the classes/workshops at the spa. The turtle conservation is so impressive! Definitely recommend to check it out! The dolphin cruise was a beautiful excursion too. Overall, it was a very relaxing and romantic trip! I‚Äôd highly recommend it to any couple on their honeymoon!"

"Six Senses Laamu is the best resort we‚Äôve ever been to! The whole experience is amazing! Customer service is top notch! Shout out to Ameen, our GEM who took care of our family during our stay on April 1-7. Ameen did an excellent job in his work.  My kid likes the Kid Club a lot. It offers a lot of fun activities such as fishing, soap making. The activities at Kid Club are well organized.   Snorkeling at House Reef is a must! We saw a lot of fish, turtles, and octopuses. We did Finding Nemos as well. It was worth the money.   I highly recommended this resort!  The positive reviews at this resort prove themselves."
"Wonderful days at Six Senses Maldives. Time to forget about any worry. Very good snorkling at only a jump and lots of colorful fishes, turtles, rays, dolphins jumping that you can see with a cocktail in your hand at sunset. Excellent service by everybody, especially our GEM Gabriel, who did his utmost so we had to bother about anything and could take the best out of everything."
"Beautiful sustainable resort, excellent staff and service with great attention to detail. Staff very friendly and discreetly attentive.  Our Guest Experience Maker Nura was spot on the whole time.

Great range of activities on offer.  Definitely a very special place to stay."
"Six senses is comfortably the best hotel / resort we have both ever stayed at. The location is amazing and beyond anything you can imagine. The staff and service (particularly our GEM Sobah) was unbelievable. From pick up the whole trip was flawless. It was our first stay at a six senses resort and we will now gladly stay at the chain again. Our only concern is that our experience at Six Senses Laamu is, in our opinion, unmatchable. "

Everything was perfect, from the island itself, the food, the water Villa we stayed on, the water activities, the diving -thank you Dotty who was our great dive instructor and of course Abdulla, our fab butler who helped us with anything and everything we needed. Such a very special place. Would be a huge miss for anyone not to go to sixth senses in their lifetime. A dream come true. Thank you again to all the staff who made this holiday so perfect xx"
"My wife, son and I recently spent a magical 9 days at Six Senses, Laamu in the Maldives.We've stayed at really nice resorts before, but this was different. It all starts with the Guest Experience Manager (GEM) who is responsible for taking care of the guest while they are there and really marshaling the resources of the staff to help the¬†guests. Ours was Hamzath whose kind grace, but assertiveness in making sure our needs were met really made our vacation (He didn't ask - ""Is everything good."" He asked ""Is there anything we can do to make your stay better?"" which is a wonderful question to be asked (tho the answer was usually ""No, it's all great!""). Just one example - My wife lost her rash guard. So while we were scouring the property trying to remember where she might have left‚Ä¶"
"My honeymoon at Six Senses Laamu was a dream come true. I'm now a die-hard fan of this incredible resort.  After months of careful research, my husband chose Six Senses Laamu from among the many resorts in the Maldives. Before my arrival, I knew little about this resort. If I were to depict my first encounter with Six Senses, it would definitely be ‚Äúlove at first sight‚Äù. Just like how you can meet different people, and one day you can meet someone and immediately know that they are the one, your soulmate, in your lifetime.

"I highly recommend Six Senses Laamu, as it provides a top-quality, exceptional experience located on a small Maldive island paradise in Laamu Atoll.  We visited the island during easter week for 5 nights with my wife and my two teen daughters.

The service was impeccable from the transportation towards and from the resort, where dedicated people in the airport will manage everything for you, including check-in, luggage management etc.,  The island itself is a paradise.

"I cannot express just how amazing our experience was at Six Senses Laamu. The place is a paradise on earth. First of all let me start off with the island itself. Laamu is simply stunning, absolutely no question. We have stayed in the Maldives before and the natural beauty of Laamu is simply unmatched. The beaches, the clarity of the sea, and the beautiful reef is the best we have seen. Having six senses as the only resort in Laamu will have certainly made a difference. The facilities of the resort are so special. There is a luxurious feel everywhere you go but with a real world understated way about it rather than tacky and disconnected. The restaurants and the food are just exceptional. Every single one of the restaurants we are at was fantastic. None of the typical generic‚Ä¶"
Absolutely amazing resort. The entire staff made you feel welcomed everyday all day long. Our GEM Amsood treated us like royalty and took very good care of us! All around the resort was authentically natural yet luxurious.

After this trip, I will recommend it to my friends who want to go to Maldives. The sixth sense is really super  It's great, it's worth everyone to relax and have fun!"
"We have just returned from our second visit to Six Senses, after first honeymooning in 2020. We rarely return to resorts, usually preferring to explore the world.  Six Senses was impressive in 2020, and so we were excited yet had high expectations for a return visit, wondering if the expectations could possibly be matched.  Despite these high expectations, we were even more blown away and impressed second time around - the resort had raised the bar in 2023.  The trip was exceptional and exceeded all our expectations from start to finish.  We couldn't recommend it more highly - it is by far our favourite resort of any we have experienced - and we'll undoubtedly be back.  But what makes it so impressive - and in our view, peerless?  The overwater villas are beautiful.  They're not‚Ä¶"

"Six Senses Lamuu is in the most beautiful of atolls with amazing marine life just a short snorkel away. The over water villas are really well designed both aesthetically and functionally. The food in every ones of the restaurants and bars is delicious, varied and well presented; with choices to suit every taste. But more than anything it is the amazing staff who make this such a  special place."
"   I recently joined a friend for a 10-day stay at Six Senses Laamu.  Every aspect of this adventure was top-notch.  Friendly Six Senses liaisons greeted me at the Male airport and took charge of my bags. From that point on, the resort staff managed every detail of my onward travel. They ensconced me in the business lounge, checked me in for my domestic connection, and saw me to security when the flight was ready for boarding. At the local airport, more staff greeted me, collected my luggage, and accompanied me to the lovely modern speedboat that would shuttle me to the resort. The boat crew gave me a cool towel, a refreshing drink, and a linen bag for my shoes. 15 minutes later, barefoot and relaxed, we arrived.     The ENTIRE management staff was assembled at the dock as a‚Ä¶"
"This was our 2nd visit to six senses laamu & everything we wanted for a perfect honeymoon & relaxing destination. The island is of perfect size and you can see all sorts of sea life without even going to the sea. Of course if you do, the snorkeling is great. You can get in a kayak for free if you do not want to be fully in the water.    #Rooms : Rooms were cleaned two times a day which kept the place very clean. Every small thing provided in the room for guests comfort. We could leave anything in the room lying around without any fear of it getting stolen!!   #Food : Breakfast buffet is terrific as always with selections of breads, eggs, waffles, pancakes etc..Food was superb in all aspects, particularly the varieties  was astounding  in all the restaurants during the dinners.  ‚Ä¶"

"This was my second week-long stay at Six Senses Laamu and I'm already counting down the days until I can schedule my third!  It's now my global destination of choice to relax, reboot and occasionally (like last New Year's Eve) rejoice! For my taste (as a reader, foodie and sun-lover), this resort sets the standard for laid-back luxury. The staff is very professional and attentive while being both friendly and unobtrusive. (Throughout my travels, I've found this combination to be all too rare.) The rooms are comfy, quiet and spacious, the spa is first-class, each of the 4 restaurants is wonderful and distinct, the vibe is totally chill and the ocean life is abundant and visible in the clear blue water from jetty, boat, beach or hammock! Did I mention that Laamu happens to be one‚Ä¶"
"We had a fantastic time. Highly recommend the guided tour of the house coral reef with a marine biologist from MUI - we learnt so much and saw such an incredible array of wildlife. Sadly we weren‚Äôt there for the guided sea grass tour which I‚Äôm sure is just as great as we saw turtles every time we went off Jetty C! Looking forward to bringing our kids to SHELL. The sustainability effort at the resort is great. Our favourite restaurant was Leaf - thanks to our GEM Gabriel for getting us a reservation. All the staff were friendly and accomodating, and Gabriel ensured we had a lovely time. We will definitely be back!  "
An amazing island with pretty beaches. The staffs are all very helpful & made us feel at home away from home. The beaches are well cleaned & very attentive bar staffs. Free Ice cream with many flavors throughout the day was our favorite.  Every day in the morning there was complimentary guided snorkeling in the house reef & we joined on two days & we had a great experience. Beautiful reefs with colorful fishes.  To put aside the good things & the bad part was we felt like a vacation at the airport as both arrival & departure also we had to wait four hours in Male' airport for our next flight. No food after 10:30 pm as there was no room service too. Restaurants are very much packed during dinner. The water pressure in the shower is very low & it can't be fixed too. Prices are too‚Ä¶
Me & my partner had been to Maldives in the past & enjoyed the experience so much that we decided to make a come back. Unfortunately it was six senses laamu and it has left a very sour taste.  From the very outset we landed to Male‚Äô airport we found the experience so bad. We had to wait in the airport for almost five hours for our connection domestic flight to resort. We were informed by the airport staffs of the resort that it is usual on most of the days as for our surprise we were been informed otherwise during the reservation.   Upon arriving to the resort a team from management welcomed all the guests but seems like no one was worried about the waiting hours in airport & said that not a single apology was extended (maybe normal). This  was the only time we met anyone from‚Ä¶
"We arrived to Six Senses Laamu after a 10 hour flight from London, 40 minute seaplane journey and finally a 30 minute boat transfer from the local airport.  On the way to the resort, we passed some dolphins spinning away, which was amazing.  When we arrived we were greeted by the team at Six Senses and then introduced to our GEM Thohir.  We were shown around the resort and then to our room.  At this point it rained, which was the only blemish on our stay.  The main reason for us choosing resort was for the snorkelling, the Junior Marine Biology (JMB) Programme and for the sustainability aspect.  I loathe the idea of taking my two children on holiday without educating them in same way or other.    Snorkelling was out of those world.  We stayed on a overwater villa and had such‚Ä¶"
"Absolutely as advertised: beautiful property, service was impeccable and on point. While it does take quite a jaunt to get there from the USA, it‚Äôs well worth the flights.    They start by meeting you at the main airport in Male and effectively white glove the experience from there.  They handle bags, checkin, etc while you wait in lounge for Maldivian airlines to Laamu.    Once there they transfer you to a boat, take your shoes ;-) and let you sit back for the 20 minute ride.   The greeting and checkin is a special experience and sets the stage for the entire stay.    There are more employees than guests if that tells you anything.   We will definitely tell everyone about this experience"
"We first visited Six Senses Laamu in March 2022 for my 50th birthday and as soon as we returned home we rebooked for the following year.    From the moment you arrive you are encouraged to hand over your shoes and it is impossible not to feel utter relaxation. The setting is complete paradise.  The most beautiful beach, which felt like we had to ourselves most days.  Crystal clear turquoise waters teaming with reef fish which we enjoyed snorkelling in daily along with a marine biologist who pointed out our first shark encounter. Absolutely breathtaking!  Every meal we ate was exceptional. The asian street food night being a particular favourite and the chefs are incredible. Breakfast was always a pleasure as the staff are so attentive, friendly and will always let you know when‚Ä¶"
"Fabulous holiday from start to finish. We split our time between a beach villa and an overwater villa. Hard to pick a favourite! Beach felt more spacious and private, but being right over the water is also wonderful. The bathrooms in both were wonderful.  We ate so well. All meals were exceptional. Such an array of gorgeous fresh produce, just delicious.   There‚Äôs something special about Laamu. Everyone there just loves it, and loads of people seem to return year after year. You feel it from the second you step off the boat onto the island. Guests and hosts alike were unfailingly friendly. We were so so well looked after by our Gem Nura and all of her colleagues. Honestly, there‚Äôs nothing I‚Äôd change about the place.   Food, rooms, house reef, wonderful staff, fascinating‚Ä¶"
"What's so amazing is that it all seems effortless. It‚Äôs not. This is a purposeful and authentic experience that‚Äôs the result of a vision and hard work. The staff is wonderful and embrace the sustainability focus. They come from the nearby remote islands and thus Six Senses has provided them meaningful jobs that empowers them to develop individually and connect with the wider world. Clearly the Maldives has talent - lots. We came away inspired by the deep passion for sustainability to protect the unique maritime nature. This will help us change out thinking and behaviour. The staff was great: Eka, Sara, Diwya, .. and many more - not the least Shah our host. We bow in respect for what the team and management has created here! An inspiration for anyone in the hospitality sector.‚Ä¶"
"We just love six senses laamu. Pure luxury. In the best way. Because of course the villas are spacious and beautiful. Of course the beaches, the water and the food are fantastic. The best is the people, the local staff, the hospitality, the concept about sustainability in all senses. You feel it all over. Six Senses try to create a better world through and together with the local people. There are so many great people. Laisha. Eka. Tooto and many more. Shah our host was an outstanding professional - and a real gem.  Actually it is very emotional to leave this wonderful place. We will for sure come back."
"Thank you to all the staff at Laamu (especially Nura). It is pure paradise, the island, villas, beach, snorkelling, spa, gym, marine centre and food were incredible and topped off with amazing service"
"My husband and I went to the Six Senses Laamu as part of our honeymoon and could not be happier with the resort and experience. The resort is on one of the more remote islands so does take a little while to get to as you have to take another domestic plane when you land in Male and then a speedboat. This is the only con of the entire stay and the Six Senses makes sure this transition is as seamless and as comfortable as possible. It is also very nice not to have any planes overhead during your stay so being more remote definitely has its perks as well.   Once at the resort, you are welcomed by the staff and you meet your GEM (guest experience manager) who takes care of making sure your stay is the best it can be. Our GEM was Shah who is an absolute gem (pun intended). He has‚Ä¶"
"We just returned from our honeymoon to this stunning resort!  We were blown away by the service, food, staff and overall experience.  It is easily the most beautiful place I‚Äôve ever been, and I have travelled quite a bit. There are tons of awesome activities to experience on the island as well‚Äî I‚Äôm an avid surfer and  doing a 2.5 hour surf session with Tropicsurf (twice actually!) was a highlight! Travis and Erin are amazing instructors. I‚Äôve surfed half my life and learned some very useful tips from them.  The best part is you get to surf perfect swells by yourself!  I would have surfed more if I had the energy.  The dolphin cruise and spa offerings were incredible as well.  Nura was our GEM and she made the trip extra special, ensuring every detail was taken care of.  I‚Ä¶"
This was a return visit and we were lucky enough to have a villa by the sea grass which was brilliant as we had regular sighting of turtles and rays passing by. It‚Äôs so brilliant that the sea grass is protected on this island. A new addition this year was the SHELL an amazing education centre with so much information and learning experiences and regular talks from the MUI marine biology team - as always the food was brilliant - and the snorkelling was just amazing as always - recommend the daily snorkel led by the MUI team to learn as you go !
We just came back from a stupendous week at Six Senses Laamu. The experience was incredible. The resort is kept at perfection by the Six Senses team. Special mention to our Guest Experience Maker Gabriel Styger who took care of us!!
"Alk the complex is a paradise, but the best I could live ar Six Senses is that I never felt alone. All the staff is working ifor your  enjoyiing. I'm very gratefull to all the people that gave us the beautifull experience of being there. Specially I'm gratefull to Shiham -my assistance- and to Salem, who was always attending my requires. Really that trip wos for me a six stars  experience. I ' ll never forget they brought me very quickli to de Doctor's wuen I had a problem in my leg. I' ll return Six Senses on my next holydays. Thank you very much to all the staff"
"We went for Laamu on our anniversay trip and it was everything and more that we hoped for.  The place itself is magnificent - the fact that the common area, (reception, diving, breakfast restaurant and chill bar) is on water is an added treat that we really appreciated - we saw sea turtles as well as reef sharks from the restaurant and that was just wauw. I also believe that having it on water is rather unique for this type of resort.  The staff is a story on their own - there are many so the place is in tip top shape - from clean beaches to chef's at all stations for breakfast - but most of all they are so nice and firendly that you can only feel at home.  Once you arrive by boat you are assigned a GEM (Guest Experience Maker) and they take care of you all the time you are‚Ä¶"
"Idyllic, rustic luxury at its best!  From the moment you set foot on the island you can't help but Chill....which unsurprisingly is also the name of their bar!    Food is exquisite and it was lovely to see a lot of veggies, eggs and drinking water produced in resort....along with their own delicious chocolates and complimentary sorbet and ice cream station  48 AMAZING flavours to choose from..Yuzu was particularly tongue tinglingly good.  The snorkelling is great and I can highly recommend the sunset dolphin cruise....and of course Six Senses USP - their spa!!!  The GEMs (Guest Experience Makers) really live up to their name and will make your stay extra enjoyable by ensuring you make the most of your stay.  They are also always up for a game of 'guest v's staff' volleyball or‚Ä¶"
"It's difficult to know where to start in reviewing this incredible destination, beautifully appointed water villas, exquisite dining, staff that couldn't do enough for you and an overwhelming commitment to save the planet.  A 20 minute speedboat ride gave us the chance to take our shoes off and not put them on again until the return trip 2 weeks later.  This is not the place for heels or dressing for dinner (although it's not against the rules if you want to).  At full capacity, this island resort can cater for 200 people, it never once felt busy with 4 restaurants serving the finest food, (Japanese, Mediterranean, Maldivian, Thai & Indian along with the best pizzas and burgers ever).    It is impossible to pick out any one member of staff as the whole team from the gardeners,‚Ä¶"
"We had the most fantastic 11-day stay at Six Senses Laamu in March. From the moment we arrived we felt very welcome and relaxed and it was truly one of our best ever holidays.   Our GEM, Sobah, was absolutely fantastic - he was so helpful, very welcoming and he responded very swiftly to any questions or requests we had. He really ensured that we had a very special holiday and made a real difference to our overall experience.  He felt truly like a friend of ours by the time we departed. Thank you so much, Sobah!    We also found all staff members we met at Six Senses to be incredibly helpful, welcoming, polite and friendly. It was surprising how many of the staff seemed to know our names or what we liked to drink, where we liked to sit etc, and there are too many to mention‚Ä¶"
"They changed my experience from wanting to go home right away to not wanting to go home and can't wait to come back again. When I arrived the weather was bad, the villa I chose was not in accordance with my preferences. The hotel replaced my villa according to my wishes, the weather improved... But what delighted me was the concept of the resort and the people who work there. Fascinating marine biologists,  taking care of ocean and daily workshops in their center that bring the underwater world closer to you.  The real  sustainability.  Snorkeling every day, a large selection of activities, beautiful surroundings and the greenery of the island itself.  A fantastic spa with expert staff and superb treatments.  Choice of restaurants, quality and presentation of food.  Special‚Ä¶"
"The most stunning resort and beautiful beaches. The staff are the best, everyone goes above and beyond to make your experience as enjoyable as possible. Our GEM - Shah was 10/10 and went to every effort to ensure we had the best time. Shah was attentive, informative and always cheerful. One of our favourite parts of the day was chatting to Shah as he never failed to make us smile!  We can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
"A wonderful resort where you can live barefoot in a beautiful setting.  All services are of excellent quality (water sports, food, spa, accommodation, and the staff is highly qualified and professional).  Already wish to return.   A special MERCI to our GEM Ainura !"
"Fantastic hotel set in stunning surroundings of ocean, corals and nature. I loved everything about this property: the cuisine is spectacular, service was exceptional, SPA was fantastic.   Many thanks to all the team, and special thanks to our GEM Ainura she made our holiday unforgettable.   Can‚Äôt wait to come back again. "
We had a superb stay in Six Senses Laamu. It was a family holiday celebrating our honeymoon.  Six Senses really deserves its place among the greatest luxury hospitality brands. For us it is the number 1. We already visited several sex senses resorts and hopefully many more to come. Special thanks to our GEM (Guest Experience Manager) Gabriel Styger. He did everything to make our stay memorable. It almost felt like he was a family member. The GEM concept in general works extremely well in Six Senses.  The quality of the rooms and the resort is also perfect. It scores a 5/5 on all terrains. We had a water villa and it was extremely comfortable with 2 children.  It is a place to fully unwind and connect with the sea and nature.  Also the concept of sustainability is worth‚Ä¶
"‚ÄúThe service was great and they generally make an effort to remember who is who. For example the waiter remembered I had a stomach problem and recommended tea and honey the next day at dinner. Even though on couples of occasions, coconut water  was not available in the island & since my wife likes coconut water a lot the butler manager Nafiz brought coconuts from the local island nearby just for us which made my wife super happy. Special mention must be made to our butler Aslah, who was really friendly and went above and beyond to make our stay a happy one. For my surprise proposal, he helped to coordinate the many moving parts and ensured everything went smoothly. It was a really magical evening for both of us.   Beyond that are corals with some pretty fish. I only got a chance‚Ä¶"
"A 5th visit to Laamu did not disappoint, returning with a family of 4 we were welcomed back to what we call our 2nd home. We were treated so well and looked after just like we were family.   7 nights in a beach pool villa with a 7 and a 3 year old.  The food was great as usual and the champagne and wine lists were better than ever.  looking forward to returning again soon"
"It was our 3rd stay at Six Senses and again everything was just perfect - from the relaxed atmosphere to the quality of the food and drinks to the friendliness and competence of all the staff. We would especially like to mention our GEM Abdulla, who took excellent care of us as always, as well as Livan and Atif (hopefully the names are spelled approximately correctly) from the restaurants, who were always in a good mood.  The massages are also highly recommended. However, at these prices, there should be a complimentary tea afterwards - as in previous years; this would be a nice closure of the treatment in the spa.  We would also like to positively highlight the hotel's activities in relation to the protection of the ocean, the MUI and the new centre ""Shell"" - really impressive‚Ä¶"
"This was our second visit to the Maldives, but our first to Six Senses Laamu.  What an absolutely amazing experience.  From the moment we arrived we felt relaxed.  Ash was our GEM and he is the best we have ever had.    He had dinner recommendations and reservations made for our entire stay upon arrival as the resort was very full.  We didnt have to worry or think about it, it was just taken care of.  Ash was always smiling and took care of any request we had.    We really enjoyed the sustainability tour, it is great to be able to see the heart of the island and see all the effort that goes in to making it what it is.    We did a snorkeling tour with the marine biologists early on in our trip, and we are glad we did.  The amount of turtles and rays around the island is‚Ä¶"
"It was one of the best experiences of my life. Magnifique nature with an exceptional experience in six senses. This experience was very special not only because of the hotel infraestructure but mainly because of the GEM Shah and all the other persons that work there as Sarah, Cush, Anna and everyone we have had the opportunity to meet. "
"After a several-year COVID-driven travel hiatus, I knew I wanted to go all out for my milestone birthday and decided, somewhat on a whim, that I wanted to go to the Maldives. I reached out to the only person I knew in my life who had been to the area, and he recommended Six Senses Laamu without hesitation. After getting the run-down of his visit from several years prior, and seeing all of the sustainability notes the resort and brand seemed to emphasize online, we decided it was a great way to go and booked our trip.  We signed up for the honeymoon package because my husband and I had actually started planning a belated honeymoon in 2020 that obviously got cancelled, and the Six Senses Laamu team who manages packages and booking was incredibly helpful and communicative‚Ä¶"
"We absolutely loved our trip to six senses! We made this our premier destination for our honeymoon and could not have been more pleased with visit. The resort is immaculate and the staff is top notch. We have never experienced such hospitality before. Every single host is extremely helpful and willing to go the extreme lengths to ensure your stay is perfect.   Each visitor is assigned a Guest Experience Manager (GEM) upon arrival. Our GEM, Shah, was honestly one of the most pleasant and helpful human beings I have ever met. He was easily accessible at all times, extremely helpful, and just and absolute delight to be around. He personally made our experience one that we will never forget and is definitely a big reason why we would like to one day return to Six Senses!"
"Having stayed many times in the Maldives over the past few years. Staying at the Six senses Laamu was without doubt one of the best experiences I‚Äôve had not just in the Maldives but around the world. The resort and everything about it exceed expectations way above what I have experienced over 20+ years of travelling. I had booked an 8 night stay back in 2022 so was incredibly excited about the holiday. From the initial contact with the resort to leaving to travel home no detail was missed. When you land In Male you are met by a six senses representative who takes care of everything for you. You are checked in for your flight out to the closest atoll then settled in the departure lounge where you can relax, have a coffee or a bite to eat. Once the domestic plane is ready you are‚Ä¶"
"Wow, what a stunning holiday we have just had at Six Senses Laamu.  This is one if those hotels that you fall in love with and you want to return to again and again.  It ticked so many boxes.  The fact that I didn‚Äôt have to wear shoes for a whole ten days was absolutely blissful.  My feet had the best holiday ever.   We were greeted on our arrival and assigned a very attentive, friendly, General Experience Manager called Masthooq who settled us in to our fabulous water villa.  If we needed anything Masthooq was there to sort it out, from our dinner reservations to boat trips.  The water villa had everything we needed and within twenty strokes in the sea we had our own little coral reef where we were visited by a few cowtail stingrays sunbathing in the sand in the afternoons. ‚Ä¶"
"12 hours here and the stresses of normal life are forgotten.  Excellent food. Stunning Location. Truly phenomenal staff. The standout of whom was our GEM Abudulla, the best we have had in 7 stays at different 6S hotels around the world in the last 15 months. It is a real slog to get there, but grit your teeth and it is really worth it. We are looking forward to (and saving up for!) our next visit. Hoping Abdulla is still there to take care of us. It is the first time I have almost shed a tear upon leaving a hotel. Special."
"It has been a great pleasure enjoy of this wonderful hotel in this idyllic island  Congratulations for their  kind treatment, excellent organization, sustainability and the marine research and conservation project."
"Six Senses Laamu is heaven on earth.  Absolutely everything about the resort has been expertly thought through and executed.  From the exquisitely decorated rooms and extensive offering of the facilities, the various restaurants serving delicious Michelin star quality food, and the particularly kind and thoughtful staff.  We were particularly impressed by our GEM, Abdulla, who went above and beyond to make our stay effortless and enjoyable.  He was super discreet, kind and went the extra mile throughout our stay.  Amaan was also terrific - taking care of us for two dinner services and making dining fun.  But all the staff deserve credit as well - they seem to genuinely love their jobs and being a part of Six Senses.  This was our second time at the resort and we've now been‚Ä¶"
"We chose this IHG property based on reviews and online feedback and it did not disappoint.  The rooms were spacious and well supplied and the water around the units was like a screensaver. The difference maker was the GEM: The Guest Experience Manager.  We had Ameen.  He was incredible and was our contact for everything we wanted to do from experiences to dinner reservations.  He appeared to love his job and where he worked.  He was available any time and made our stay perfect. This seemed to be the theme here.  Having not been to this part of the world before, they met us at the Male airport and took care of everything: from luggage to check in‚Ä¶everything.   This is a long trip coming from the United States but I would highly recommend.  "
"After 30+ years of travel in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas, we have found absolute perfection at the Six Senses Laamu. We can say that this was our best holiday ever.  We are a family of 3 (7 year old daughter) and our in laws. Everyone found something lovely to do at this little slice of paradise.  The natural beauty of the island is breathtaking, but especially the way the resort was built to make full use of it, and yet to be as sustainable as possible.  The main dining areas were nicely spaced out with so many different little nooks and crannies to enjoy the nature around you.  So many RockStar Team Members, I couldn't possibly mention all, but special shout outs to  Our GEM Masthooq - took wonderful care of us, very helpfuyl suggestions, made everything look‚Ä¶"
"From the first minute - already at the pick-up at Kadhdhoo airport, one feels warmly welcomed at Six Senses Laamu. Especially our personal GEM (Guest Experience Maker) - Shah - was incredibly caring and lovely. Excellent food in all restaurants. Extremely recommended: 48 different flavors of ice cream to taste. Fantastic in-house reef for snorkeling (eagle rays, turtles, reef sharks, etc.). In other words: a dream vacation in a dream establishment. 100% recommendation"
"My wife and I spent 5 night for our honeymoon  at Six Senses Laamu. Needless to say we were absolutely thrilled with our time there.  From the time we arrived in the Maldives the experience was flawless. We flew in from the US and were tired after a long trip. We were met in Male by a representative that ushered us to a lounge and prepped us for our domestic transfer. They took care of all the formalities and got us on to our domestic flight. After our domestic flight, we were ushered on to a boat to the resort.  At the resort we were introduced to our guest experience manager Shihan, and the rest of the staff. Shihan was absolutely phenomenal during our time. He was attentive and he and the other staff made sure they were flawless in execution and always available. The staff‚Ä¶"
"We stayed at the Six Senses for 6 nights on our honeymoon. To say it exceeded our high expectations is an understatement. The hotel and its surroundings are spectacular, the food was excellent, the spa was incredible, but what really set our trip apart was the service.  Our GEM, Amsood, is phenomenal, and he went above and beyond to make sure our stay was nothing short of perfect.  We are not typically repeat travelers, but we already cannot wait to visit this special place again. A sincere thank you to the entire team for making this the best trip yet! "
"This was my 6th visit to Six Senses Laamu. I love every aspect of it and it feels like home, but then better. The people working here are all super stars, everyone smiles and greets you by name when you cycle around the resort bare feet. Snorkeling in the housereef and the see grass is always very rewarding and this year we were utterly lucky to see 34 Mobula Rays in a nearby reef. Sunrise yoga with Jimmy, wonderfully relaxing spa treatments with Anil and Yanni, service with a smile by Toto and Hafiz, great snorkeling trip with Junior and Aalif, the amazing food everywhere any time of day, accompanied by the great wine choices of the sommeliers all 10 out of 10! My son and I were fortunate enough to experience the opening of Shell, the Sea Hub of Environmental Learning in Laamu.‚Ä¶"
"What an amazing place. The staff are so friendly and go out of their way to make your holiday special . All the staff give you great eye contact , are always looking up, smiling and communicating, they seem so happy. The website doesn‚Äôt do it justice with what‚Äôs on offer or how amazing this place is.  I picked six sense Laamu due to its unique offering and location . they have it all, from an amazing spa , fitness , watersports to adventure off the resort.   You definitely need a least two weeks here.   The snorkelling was amazing and you can see black tipped sharks, rays and turtle right outside your water villa. I took a private speed boat tour and snorkelling in the deep and had lunch on a deserted island . Something I will never forget.   I Managed to get an early morning‚Ä¶"
"The most amazing experience I ever had. Ashraq made the experience something unique always to remember! Helpful, warm-heartet, fun and always ready to inform and help! We are all very thankful to him for making this holliday a once in a lifetime experience!! As were all the other people working at SixSenses!! The food was fantastic - and I am rather picky about my food üòÖ - the design of the resort was beautyful and all the activities were overwhelming - so much good and hard to choose‚Ä¶ "
"Six Senses Laamu was incredible. From the delicious & copious selection of food & restaurants, to the activities (some complimentary some for a fee), to the clean & well designed water villa we stayed in, to the amazing GEM (guest experience maker) Shah whom was assigned to take care of us, we couldn‚Äôt have expected a better overall time in the Maldives.  Food: half board allowed us breakfast & dinner, which was largely enough! The daily buffet breakfast can be taken in the restaurant or in your villa. You could have dinner in any of their restaurants & there are always theme dinners!

"Overall every aspect of our experience in Six Senses was outstanding! From the reception at the airport in Male to the reception in the island, the staff was in its excellency.  The villa and the surrounding all together is just a little piece of paradise. The variety and quality of food that the different restaurants offer is amazing, and difficult for anyone not to find their choice. Last but not least, Gabriel our GEM during our stay, was by all means a very precious and professional asset. In fact, he was at the core of making everything smooth and easy for us to experience the best of the Six Senses."

"This was our first time trip to the Maldives, and we didn‚Äôt quite know what to expect. What we experienced though was exceptional - in all ways. From the first time we were greeted in Male airport, then again at the boat harbour for our ride to Laamu, where we were asked to put our shoes in a bag and not not wear them again for the rest of our stay‚Ä¶‚Äùas the only mark six senses want us to leave on the atol was our foot prints in the sand!‚Äô Well, that‚Äôs what we did and we loved it.

The whole experience from start to finish was 5 Star all the way . The accommodation was absolutely 5 star all the way with everything at your Finger tip ! The views were just like out of a movie clear water and beautiful sunshine ! The staff went beyond what you would expect from 5 star . Our General Experience Manager Shah was undoubtedly the most attentive and efficient staff member I have ever encountered anywhere in the world! All the staff were excellent and couldn‚Äôt do enough to make our stay absolutely fantastic. The food was beautiful and everyone helped to make it the most memorable holiday imaginable  I would advise anyone who possibly can pay a visit to this hotel and beautiful island  Thank you so much to all the staff we will certainly be back again
There is not a single place that compares to Six Senses Laamu.  The most amazing concept of Six Senses Laamu holidays is that you don‚Äôt wear shoes for the entire stay. You get your shoe bag straight when you get on a boat.  After arrival we were greeted on the welcome dock by the managers of each department. Our wonderful GEM Ainura added personal touch to every moment of our stay to keep it as memorable as possible! She was checking on us everyday mornings and evenings to make sure we love the Six Senses experience ü´∂üèª  We stayed in the Ocean Water Villa-room was absolutely beautiful in every aspect.

"Everything was really perfect. I and my boyfriend had such a romantic stay at Six senses Laamu and we are beyond happy with all the straff, and Stephany who helped us with everything during our stay. We cannot wait to go back to this dream place. "
"The best hotel ever! We had a fantastic time since we arrived to the island and at the end of our vacations we really didn't want to leave the hotel. Everything is wonderful, the beach is so pretty, the rooms are amazing and the service is the best. Thanks to Masthooq, our Guest Experience Manager, our experience was even better.  He was in charge of arranging our reservations and everything we needed at the hotel, he helped us a lot.  Our room was in the ocean so we had a fantastic view, it was big and confortable. If you like to snorkel this is a beautiful place to do it. You can find turtles, rays and many beautiful fish. The restaurants are very good. The buffet breakfast is very complete and delicious. It is also a wonderful place for kids. My son was so happy at the hotel:‚Ä¶"
"Best experience with an amazing service and support by Gabriel  who was our GEM. Gabriel made the difference and for sure he is an asset to the resort. The facilities are great, the landscape is amazing, the crew is exceptional warm and supportive, and you really feel there like heaven, Prices of food are too expensive.- This is the only negative remark."
"Six Senses Laamu is by far the BEST resort I have ever stayed at. Their impeccable staff and alluring activities (whether it is a relaxing spa or an adventurous dive in the ocean with manta rays and sea turtles) created the most memorable experience for me and my family. Our GEM Masthooq was a literal gem, who curated our itinerary to perfection. I stayed at the Sunset Water Villa, where I basked in rays of sunshine while watching streaks of mesmerizing colours sink into the horizon during the sunrise and sunset. The people on the entire island are so friendly and helpful. With special thanks and appreciation to the lovely Sharra, who has the most caring heart; to Diwya & Ismail, who have the sweetest soul and are the best chefs; to Jaako, who is so so kind and observant. No‚Ä¶"
"Went to Six Senses Laamu on our Babymoon and what an experience from start to finish. Stayed in a laamu water villa on jetty C and used our bikes daily to get around the island. jetty C is the furthest jetty from the main area and so nicely secluded.   The staff were all super friendly and chatty and our GEM Gabriel was a legend who looked after everything we needed.  The food was out of this world. Every meal we had during our 7 nights was incredible and breakfast has everything you want and more. Our favourite evening meal was the Asian night and it started off the holiday very well. With my wife being 7 months pregnant they were careful and knowledgeable about what she could and couldn‚Äôt eat.  All activities (spa, water sports, dolphin cruise, snorkelling) were all brilliant‚Ä¶"
"we stayed at Six Senses Laamu for ten days with our four-year-old daughter. After a long journey, we were already rewarded on the first evening: this resort is very special in many aspects: because it is currently ""on vogue"" to practice sustainable tourism, certainly also the consistent implementation of this, without being intrusive. But we were very impressed by how great they treat their ""hosts"" here, the predominantly local staff. The principle that a good host can only be a good host if he is also a happy employee is fully and consistently implemented here. For us as guests, this means that we were always surrounded not only by friendly faces, but by honest, wholehearted, beaming faces. You can't really ask for anything more on a holiday. Apart from that, the resort is‚Ä¶"
"We had a wonderful time at Six Senses in January celebrating our honeymoon. It couldn't have been more perfect for what we were looking for - the ethos of the island is relaxed and with a focus on sustainability, with fantastic options to either fully switch off and wind down, and/or get involved in some great activities (for example, we had our first experience of scuba diving, and a day out on a nearby dessert island, both which we'd highly recommend). A real highlight for us was the abundance of wildlife we saw - I don't think we quite appreciated how easy it would be to spot turtles/rays/sharks on a daily basis. The food was also fantastic, and the service was amazing - nothing was too much trouble. We'd particularly like to recognise our GEM Abdulla Hassan who made our trip‚Ä¶"
"I miss this ""place"" every day. Wish I could travel to Six Senses Lamuu tomorrow again !   If you haven't been then no review will make you appreciate how special Sis Senses Lamuu is and if you have been then no need to read any reviews - you just want to go back ...and fast !"
"This is our second visit here and they whole team just continues to knock it out of the park, what can I say‚Ä¶the level of attention to detail and hospitality is next level.  Everyone knows your name, the food is great, the cocktails are delicious, the accommodations are dreamy, the services are tailored to your needs, it‚Äôs just what you need when you need it, the staff seems to know what, when and where all the time.  If they don‚Äôt they gently inquire and tailor to your needs  We came to celebrate a birthday and relax and unwind.  The whole place knew who‚Äôs birthday it was and all personally checked in to wish a happy birthday to the birthday girl, it was a lovely touch.  We also came to dive!  What a great dive center at deep blue on-site.  Our 8 yr old did the seal team scuba‚Ä¶"
"We left the Maldives over a week ago and I'm still snorkelling in my dreams.‚Ä®‚Ä®  Six Senses Laamu is like nowhere I've stayed before. From the moment we shed our shoes and stepped off the boat we were smitten. This place is so beautiful.‚Ä®‚Ä®  My daughter and I were met by off the boat by the beautiful and ever helpful Ainura, who took us on a short tour of the main resort areas before showing us to our room and explaining options for meals and various activities.‚Ä®‚Ä®  We stayed in an Ocean Water Villa towards the end of Jetty C. I was a little concerned at first that we were some distance away from the house reef and main resort area, but that wasn't an issue at all in the end and we enjoyed the bicycle rides that took us to and from our many adventures.‚Ä®‚Ä®  The king bed in our villa‚Ä¶"
"The six senses Laamu is an absolutely beautiful property. We had a very unique experience staying with this hidden gem for 6 days and 5 nights. This was our anniversary holiday. The room had been set up with anniversary decor, champagne, chocolates, fruits and a hand crafted welcome card to welcome our stay. The concept of the property is back to nature and sustainable in daily life. Everyone with bare feet to access the entire property and participate in activities. The transportation is by bike ride on the entire island. We learned so much marine life from the onsite marine biologists. The sunset dolphin cruise is a must have excursion. We had our amazing breakfast at the Longitude. Chill Bar, The Leaf, The Zen was our place to have a delicious dinner. Sip Sip was a place to‚Ä¶"
"Excellent place for a honeymoon. It offered a range of experiences, both relaxing and adventurous. We did the couples massage, private island getaway, sunken table dinner, and LOTS of scuba diving and snorkeling. Some things were a little pricey, but given the location and exceptional service, we were able to justify the cost. Our GEM Amsood went above and beyond for us and was able to get us anything we needed whenever we needed it. Highly recommend and hope to visit again soon! "
"We came back for the third time and had an even better experience than our previous visits!   The locations is beautiful and has everything one could wish for, lovely biking trails to get you where you want, amazing (heathy) food, the best accommodation and amazing staff! A perfect balance between service minded and with a good hint of personality and warmth. Thank you so much, we can‚Äôt wait to come back. Congrats Marteyn on your amazing team! With a special thanks to our gem Aslah, Lea the lovely fruit lady, Jimmy who thought the best yoga lessons and the staff from the spa who were so helpful and supportive (with a special thank you to Brayan and the GP who were so generous with their time and attention)."
Truly amazing. We had a wonderful family trip for Christmas and went on some amazing dives with Elisa who showed us great new skills and beautiful dive spots including a Mantay Ray cleaning station. Masthooq took great care of us throughout our stay organizing all our excursions and making sure we were happy and comfortable.  Highly recommend the island picnic excursion and sunset dolphin cruise. We also enjoyed every meal we had and they went above and beyond for a spectacular Christmas feast. Hope to go back some day! 
"This was the most amazing holiday on my life. Truly special and spectacular! It was our family‚Äôs first visit to Maldives. After few recommendations we selected Six Senses Laamu for your holiday stay. To say that it was a paradise island, is to say nothing. It was best choice we could make from the point of impeccable service and offering to being a an eco conscious choice among all.  From the point we arrived to the last point of leaving we were assisted and supported. 2 weeks shoe free- best thing ever! Kids club - most amazing offering, fun and educational. Lots of educational and recreational offerings for the adults as well. You wont be bored. Spa procedures! Fantastic food and unlimited icecream!  And those sunsets are like nowhere in the world!

"We delayed our honeymoon.for 4 months because of an emergency. When we were ready to re-book we decided to upgrade to six senses Maldives. Greatest possible honeymoon ever! This place had 0 flaws. The food the activities, the over water villas were so romantic. They provided his/her‚Äôs bicycles for transportation. We peddled all over the island exploring and enjoying all the sites and restaurants. Our GEM guest experience manager was awesome he helped plan each of our days including activities and meals. Amsood was great to us. We felt like royalty. We had a once in a lifetime adventure and the only downside is that the bar is set so high for any other vacation spot that they will no doubt pale in comparison. Life is rarely perfect, but it was better than perfect at six senses‚Ä¶"
"Everything about our trip was wonderful. The travel details through Six Senses were perfect and we were cared for so well starting at the airport in Male and onward to the boat taking us to the resort. As soon as we took our shoes off on the boat ride and sipped our fresh lemonade we felt relaxed. When we arrived at the island we were introduced to our GEM Shah who took us on a tour and helped us get settled in. Over the course of our trip Shah continued to be a great help making dinner reservations, arranging all of our activities, making sure all of our needs were met, all with a big smile on his face. The over-water villa we stayed in on jetty A was gorgeous both inside and the view outside. I especially loved the outdoor shower. We snorkeled 2-3 times a day - at least one of‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses in the Maldives is a stunning and luxurious resort that offers a truly unforgettable experience. The stunning scenery, combined with world-class service, makes it the perfect destination for those seeking a relaxing and rejuvenating getaway. Our GEM, Shah, went above and beyond to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. From recommending the best restaurants and activities to arranging for special surprises, he made sure that we felt truly cared for and appreciated. The attention to detail and personalized service made our trip truly special, and we would highly recommend Six Senses to anyone looking for a once-in-a-lifetime vacation experience."
"We had the most wonderful family time here. The staff was amazing. EVERYONE. Our GEM Stephanie (from Brazil) was mega attentive, our babysitter Lala so sweet, Nik and my husband had the best diving trips ever.. we cant express our gratefulness.   My husband had a diving trip with 200 dolphins! What a lifetime adventure! From the F&B manager to every staff member: people treat you sooooo incredibly nice. We love this six senses charme.   Food is awesome, the underwatee life uncomparable, the villa (we had 89) perfect, the sea biologists incredibly commited, the snorkeling breathtaking.   There are 60 different ice creams they offer for free and the lady there is the cutest person and loves her job  The kids are treated like little princesses and love their bikes with name tags on‚Ä¶"
"I legitimately cannot imagine a better resort than Six Senses Laamu. This resort is very different from everywhere else I have stayed. Not only did we not wear shoes and bike around the whole island all the time, every staff we met there was extraordinarily friendly. I know this I clich√© to say, but I truly felt connected to nature from the moment we got there. Here are the main highlights of the trip to Six Senses Laamu:  1. The staff at Six Senses Laamu are phenomenal! Once we got off the speed boat on the check-in day, the whole team of staff from the resort greeted us with such a warm welcome. At this resort, each guest is assigned with a Guest Experience Maker (GEM) who helps us with all the acitivity bookings, restaurant reservations, or any help we need in general. They‚Ä¶"
"I don‚Äôt typically write reviews, but my trip to the Maldives and stay at Six Senses was the best vacation of my entire life.   The transports to and from the airport with the Six Senses staff was perfect. They greeted us as we landed and escorted us to the resort with all of our luggage. The resort is beautiful and the over the water bungalows are bigger than I imagined. We met our gem, Shah, the first day and he made the trip so special. He arranged amazing activities for us including a trip to a private beach. I highly recommend that excursion because the private island is amazing with a hut, lounge chairs, and the food was delicious! The snorkeling at the reef was amazing too.   Riding the bikes on the Jetty was fun and the first night we were there we saw bioluminescents in‚Ä¶"
"We visited at the end of November 2023. The island is stunning as you would expect in the Maldvies at a Six Senses property.  We payed around ¬£1000 per night on a half board option in the entry level water villas. These were fine, a little worn around the edges but still a good bedroom area. On the whole the experience was good but there are a few things that just felt substandard for our expectations and their price point. Breakfast service was chaotic, nobody seemed to have a grip of what was happening and on multiple occasions items were missed or had to be chased. The room service drinks to the room were dreadful - 30 min wait, an old battered cool box and no garnish. Just not acceptable at Maldives SS prices. The villa as mentioned above did feel a little tired and was‚Ä¶"
"The best holiday ever. The resort was beautiful and clean. We stayed barefoot for 10 days.. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. Our host Thohir took care of absolutely everything we needed. The water was clear and warm. The snorkelling was outstanding and gave us a snorkel set to borrow for the trip, they lent us paddle boards at no extra cost.   The only problem is is that the bar is set so high, that it‚Äôs unlikely we could ever beat this trip"
"What a memorable and beautiful experience of a lifetime! A big THANK YOU to GEM Aslah, Samin, marine biologist Kiah, and diver Aalif for their warm, friendly hospitality; expansive knowledge; and outstanding, world-class service. We will never forget the incredible, breathtaking views of a Maldivian Sunrise and Sunset; complimentary snorkeling adventures at the local house reef; and the countless, vibrant marine life that can be appreciated from the shoreline and underwater. Six Senses truly inspired all of ours and more. We can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
"From the second you are taken in charge by the smiling and professional staff of Six Senses Laamu, your exquisite journey begins....This is without a doubt the highest quality of service, accomodation, culinary experience and overall greatness that we have ever experienced. 5 Stars are simply not enough to rate Six Senses Laamu! This resort has a unique approach when it comes to sustainability, respect of nature and economic support towards local communities. The people who work/live on the resort all play a huge part in making the whole experience unforgettable for the guests.... A very profound thanks to our GEM, Amsood, who made it his daily priority to ensure that everything was flawless and effortless for us. You have made every day so special for us....Thanks to Yusuf,‚Ä¶"
"We have just left this magical island. It has by far exceed all our expectations and they were high as we had heard from other friends who has stayed that it was special.  From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were treated so kindly by all the staff. The service is exceptional. The food is of a high end city restaurant. The snorkeling is fantastic with the reef just 20 meters from the chill bar. We saw sting rays, turtles, little sharks almost every day and dolphins too.   Special thanks to our GEM, the wonderful Tho, that made my wife and i feel ultra special and had a super care of our 2 year old Sebastiano throughout the stay.  We stayed in the ocean water villa on Jetty A. Highly recommend this spot for comfort and view.  And i would like to add that it is‚Ä¶"
"We had 5 beautiful days with no rain.  Our GEM (guest experience maker) Amsood was amazing, he took great care of us. The resort was picture perfect as described! You can find turtles, Sting rays, Sharks in three feet of water. Highly recommended if you are looking for a private and secluded resort!!!"
"This is the best resort I have ever stayed in without question. If I could I would stay here for months and months at a time. If you are thinking about staying here for your trip to The Maldives, just do it. I promise that you won‚Äôt regret it. I have stayed at many nice hotels such as Waldorf Astorias, Ritz-Carltons, Park Hyatts, and the top Alilas (Napa Valley and Ventana Big Sur) yet nothing comes even remotely close to how much we loved Six Senses Laamu.  So what makes this place so special? Why does it now hold such a special place in my heart? Is it the rooms, the location, the food, the natural beauty, the service, or the design? Yes.  Starting out with the rooms and general design, I absolutely love the all wood design of this hotel. Everything, and I mean *everything* is‚Ä¶"
"I try very hard to recall a thing I disliked, and I can‚Äôt. The no-shoe policy makes me feel more connected with the land. The surfing season usually starts around April till November, but during my stay (mid January) I surfed at turtle break twice, and the waves were both gentle and fun to ride on for novice surfers. Not to mention the staffs here were just awesome. For scuba diving, they accept PADI open water license. I haven‚Äôt dived for almost 6-year, and I had a review session and a fun dive here at the manta point. Both dives were very fruitful - I saw a manta ray,  stingrays, green turtles, leaf fishes, an octopus, and lion fishes. Again the staffs were just awesome.  The weather was better than I expected. The temperature difference during day and night time was almost‚Ä¶"
"Incredible resort! Incredible service, staff and amenities. The restaurants are delicious and the island is beautiful. We loved a snorkeling and highly recommend the private island experience.   Our GEM Aslah was very helpful and always quickly responded to our requests!"
"Coming to the end of our second visit to Six Senses Laamu and, once again, the experience was off the charts at every level. Thank you to Marteyne and her flawless hospitality team for taking care of our every whim. A special mention to Nick and the dive team at Deep Blue Divers who are outstanding.  Two superb dives (manta, sharks, turtles, Napoleon wrasse‚Ä¶what didn‚Äôt we see?) and the most extraordinary guided snorkel trip to a remote reef where we saw coral as it must have been 20 years ago. The recent opening of The Sea Hub aka ‚ÄúThe Shell‚Äù and their marine experts makes Laamu a paradise for anyone with a remote interest in diving and snorkelling. The most memorable, spoiling, relaxing, romantic holiday we could have wished for. Thank you!"
"We visited Six Senses Laamu as a family to celebrate my 50th Birthday and we hoped it would be a special stay. It was so much more than we could ever have hoped for. This is an absolutely exceptional place to stay and the sustainability, conservation and community ethos that is at the heart of everything was really inspiring to see and to be a part of. The attention to detail in every aspect of our stay was outstanding and even though everything feels very luxurious and well thought through, there is no standing on ceremony here so you can really relax and enjoy yourself. We were in the sunset villas on Jetty A. They were really comfortable (there‚Äôs even a pillow menu to ensure you get the best sleep!) with day beds in sun and shade and great amenities. Sean and the house team‚Ä¶"
"The setting of the resort is gorgeous, like stepping into a postcard. Everything is turquoise waters, sea grass meadows, white sandy beaches or palm trees swaying in the breeze.    We stayed in one of the overwater villas on jetty A and we found them fantastic, the facilities were very well thought through, good WiFi, universal plug sockets, USB charging ports, outdoor shower that was accessible from the water to limit traipsing sand and water through the villa, privacy screens also buffered external sounds, great views, personalised bikes to get around, water urns along the jetty to cool your bare feet in the hot sun, a pillow menu to maximise good rest, the list goes on. Not to mention the amazing marine life, in our eight days we saw countless fishes, two turtles, three rays‚Ä¶"

All other meals were also delicious. The staff were incredibly friendly and they went above and beyond to make guests happy. Soba took care of us during our stay and he was an absolute gem.

"We stayed here for 5 nights and flew 24 hours from California and it was absolutely worth it. The food is above and beyond anything I could have imagined. When you show up you are assigned a GEM who halls organize anything and everything you could want during your stay. Our GEM, Aslah, was fantastic. He was extremely friendly and accommodated everything we could have asked for. I also surfed with TropicSurf during my stay, Erin and Travis were my instructors and they were so awesome. We fortunately got there when the waves had picked up a bit and I had a blast surfing with each of them who I‚Äôm sure will be life long friends.

We had an amazing time.  We were looking for a once in a lifetime experience and that was certainly accomplished.  All of the staff were terrific.  The accommodations were amazing and the whole sustainability of the resort was amazing.  Aslah was our GEM who was awesome.
"We are repeat visitors to Six Senses Laamu, and the resort just keeps getting better. It's a cliche but we wish Trip Advisors offered more stars so we could express our happiness with our experience. This time, the food was especially good, and they've added many more vegetarian options. We stayed 14 nights, and we had no trouble with menu repetition and the food-boredom that can sometimes happen on long stays.  The staff was wonderful--our GEM was Afrah, wonderful as always. Leevan, Mohit, Isham, and Kabbe deserve special mention (though I might be mispelling their names) for their kindness and warmth, especially Leevan for his good conversation and sense of humor.

"My wife and I stayed at Six Senses Laamu recently while on our Honeymoon for nearly a week, and all I can say is that everything couldn't have been better. It was our first trip to the Maldives, but we had been very selective of where we wanted to stay. What drew us to Six Senses was the premium level of service and community. The attention to detail and sustainability efforts really stood out. And everyone that we interacted with at Six Senses truly delivered on service.  We were first greeted by our Guest Experience Manager (GEM) named Ashraq, who really made our trip truly special. He not only helped plan and schedule all of our amazing activities (scuba diving, surfing, private dinners, etc.) but he became a friend that substantially enhanced our experience, and took a‚Ä¶"
I have now said many times since I returned home that if I were to design my perfect resort it would be Six Senses Laamu.  Even before arriving at the resort it was obviously going to be special with small details like the fresh lemonade on the boat for the ride from the airport and the no-shoes policy which made you feel relaxed right from the start.  Then there was my  GEM.  Abdullah was absolutely amazing in helping me tailor my experiences.  Anything I needed he was there to assist.  All the staff are great.  By the end of my stay the breakfast staff all new where I liked to sit and what I wanted to drink.  My room was spectacular and I loved the pillow menu and the outdoor shower.  The food was great with lots of choices.   The spa is also wonderful with the open air‚Ä¶
"Its our third time in Six Sense Laamu in 12 months.. every time, we think it cant get any better, but it really does. From first stay at Laamu, we already knew we were in love with the place. This time, we brought both of our parents, and really.. there is nowhere else in the world we would trust more for an incredible holiday experience. It was a very special trip, and there is no other place in the world i would have enjoyed it more.  I have said before in my tripadvisor reviews of Laamu that it is the staff that makes the big difference, and i definitly still stand by that.

Thank you Nick.  "
"Our second trip to the resort  and the service was impeccable by all - three people to note in particular - Stephaney Campos who was our GEM who could not have done a better job for us with all our arrangements and Nick Ziegelmaier who was my husband's diving instructor and helped him get certified as a Specialty Diver with Driver Propulsion Vehicle certification - and helped him spot his first mante which was amazing.  Finally, Suhan who was our housekeeper and could not have done more for us. We had a fabulous time and in particular these three stood out for us."
"I recently spent 7 nights at Six Senses Laamu with my husband on our honeymoon. We were there at the very end of December 2022 and over the holidays. Our experience was exceptional from the moment we landed at the local airport and were greeted by a Guest Experience Manager (GEM) from Six Senses who took our bags and brought us to our boat to the island. The boat had cold towels and waters waiting.   Upon arrival at Six Senses we were greeted by what felt like the entire staff, including the GEM who was personally assigned to us to take care of us for the entire week.

we had the absolute best time - this was our second visit (this time with our kids) the hotel endlessly went above and beyond for us and our family and made the kids stay magical. Leaving thoughtful handl made gifts for them each night and so much more Our GEM (butler) Aniura was exceptional and looked after us 24 hours with a wonderful smile on her face and no task was too tricky. We miss it terribly and can't wait to visit. Hotel and trip of a lifetime.
Everything was handled above and beyond my expectations for service and quality.  An almost magical place close to the equator situated on a coral reef and underwater grasslands.  Snorkeling right from your cottage was amazing.  Food was culinary perfection.  Our assigned concierge (GEM) nicknamed Osh anticipated our every need and guided us in the process of choosing daily activities and food/beverage options.  Absolutely top notch service.  We used Turquoise for our travel arrangements and their app sure helped in getting through the flight/border patrol process.
"This trip was absolutely the best we have ever taken and we have traveled to a lot of places. I can't stress enough how nice the staff was to us. We have been on several Viking cruises where the staff is very nice but this was a different type of sincerity. At each of our dinner meals they would go out of their way to make sure my food wasn't prepared too spicy (a request) and was cooked to our satisfaction. All restaurants were so delicious but Leaf was my favorite.  One night they served us lobster as an appetizer followed with Wahoo and Scallops as our main dish. It was presented so beautifully and delicious!    Our GEM, Ashraq, was Amazing!!! We called him Ash.  He made our trip extra special with his warm welcome, which included an upgrade to an Ocean Villa (unit 30),‚Ä¶"

We were traveling with our 1,5 year old  son so we had some specifics needs.

The staff was amazing and so helpful. Hamzath  and Thohir were our GEMs and took extra Special care of us to see that we had all of our needs met."
"We stayed at this amazing resort for Christmas this year. It was absolutely perfect in every way. Picked a beach villa with a pool and we had so much space together with a loverly raised terrace area where we sat before sunset. Food was brilliant, such a high standard, many dishes cooked by chefs specialising in the cuisine itself, especially worthy of note was their Thai chef. House reef was great too, better than many as we saw Turtles, ray and shark too amongst all the brilliant fish and coral - often you have to take a boat trip at some resorts to see what we could just swim to see. Complementary bicycles for transport we loved as well. Would highly recommend coming here and will return ourselves. One thing that made us concerned before we travelled was the longer and more‚Ä¶"
"We had an amazing stay at six senses Laamu ! All was perfect ! The resort is beautiful and the villa was so comfortable with a wonderful view on the lagoon. Our GEM Shah was the best and made our stay memorable ! The food was also really amazing and all the staff so friendly, especially Hisham at SipSip who made us laugh everytime ! Hoping to come back soon to paradise !!"
"We had a wonderful stay in Paradise ! Our GEM shah was amazing, he was always around to make our stay the best than ever ! With him, everything is possible, he made all our wishes Come true with a smile ! We miss him and plan to go back sixsenses next year !"
"After the pandemic period, we wanted to retake longer trips with our 4-year-old kid, so we decided that Maldives would be a nice place to travel as a family. At the beginning it seemed very difficult to choose between the great range of accommodations and islands / atolls there, but having previously stayed at a Six Senses property in Vietnam (Con Dao), and checking the good reviews and offer of Six Senses Laamu, we finally decided to book for it. No doubt, it was the best choice we could have been made, as we have had one of the best travelling experiences ever (if not the best). It gets a bit longer to reach Laamu Atoll, as from Male you have to take an internal flight (less than 1 hour) and a boat ride to the island in which Six Senses is located (both very enjoyable though).‚Ä¶"
"Firstly thanks to Amsood he made every wish we had come true, he is really proud to work for Six Senses and embraces the brand‚Äôs principles.  As well as the beautiful location, the resort aims to create an incredible experience, it is amazing to be in a resort where every guest young and old looks like they are having the experience of their lives.  The employees constantly talk about how well they are treated by Six Senses and how happy they are to work there. This shows in their work.  The villas are stunning and maintained with great care. The gym has modern equipment and I enjoyed running around the island just before sunrise and seeing employees also out exercising and meditating on the end of the jetties.   All meals are delicious and the theme nights celebrate many‚Ä¶"
I went there with my boyfriend for 10 days. It was my second time at the resort and I will definitely come back again. The staff is super helpful and you get your own ‚ÄúGuest experience maker‚Äù who will take care of your every need. This was a big part of the special experience. The island is beautiful and the hotel offers many activities. I went diving 3 times with an amazing instructor (Nick). He was very professional and took us to different locations just a few minutes from the hotel where we could see many different kinds of animals. It was definitely an experience to remember. The whole thing was made very comfortable with a private boat that takes you to the spot and refreshments on board. 
"One of the best experiences ever!! Wonderful staff, very thoughfulness, always taking care of our needs.  Amazing view from the room on an over water bungalow, with complete privacy Delicious food from breakfast to dinner Our G.E.M. -Gabriel- was always attentive to our wishes and managed to accomplish it"
We had a lovely stay in Laamu during our honeymoon. We were very happy with the sunset villa on jetty A which we think is the best jetty. From our villa we had direct access to the house reef and we snorkeled everyday. The island is cute and there are plenty of activities can be followed. Food is great and our GEM is also very helpful. The only drawback of the resort is its location. As it is far from Male a domestic flight has to be taken and there were only few flights everyday.  But Being in the southern atol the island has pretty good weather in December compared to those in the north.
"The best holiday I've ever had, and my dad and I both had a great time at Six Senses Laamu.  Beauty comes from everywhere in this resort at any time:  The resort's concept is unique, as it is ""plastic free and sustainable"", which is a great way to raise awareness and promote sustainable development locally and globally.  All the staff in the resort are overwhelmingly friendly and welcoming, and it was such a pleasure to meet so many amazing people during this trip. To name a few: thank you to Dottie and Deep Blue Diving Team for letting me have an unforgettable diving experience, and the underwater scenery was spectacular -- Specifically, Dottie, she was a very professional diving instructor and always a delight to me with her cheerful and friendly personality (‚óï‚Äø‚óï‚úø); a big‚Ä¶"
"We were a family of 4 (2 daughters aged 4 & 5) in a single water villa in Jetty B. This was our first trip to Laamu and we were wowed. You get a dedicated helper (a ‚ÄúGEM‚Äù) who quickly makes it clear that nonrequest is too much. They check in with you each morning and evening and updated us about what was happening in kids club that day, which restaurants were doing themed evenings etc. Best of all we had their whatsapp so we could ping them questions whenever we wanted. Shah (our GEM) was excellent, even going so far as leaping into water of unknown depth when our youngest daughter tripped and fell off a jetty (didn‚Äôt matter as she was wearing a life jacket). Every member of staff is so warm and friendly, you quickly feel totally pampered.  There‚Äôs very little they haven‚Äôt‚Ä¶"
"We had the most incredible time at Six Senses, Laamu. It was the best holiday we‚Äôve ever had. We stayed in one of the villas over the water and they are beautifully done and very private. We did some of the excursions like the Dolphin sunset cruise which was magical. I snorkelled but the rest of my family did the scuba-diving- we all saw wonderful things. But the main thing is when you arrive you are assigned a GEM, a guest experience maker. It‚Äôs a v clever idea- he or she is your first point of call for anything and everything. Ours was Ash. He was fantastic. He was very efficient, got all questions answered and all needs met promptly and he was very charming. He was so friendly, we immediately felt really welcome and loved telling him our news at the end of the day. My husband‚Ä¶"
We were here for a week and it was really a beautiful location. Our Gem aslah fulfilled all our wishes and made our vacation an unforgettable experience.   especially the sustainability is perfectly lived here. You feel one with nature
"We had a really fun stay at Six Senses Laamu. The GEM butler systems works really well, with Ash(raq) looking after us immaculately, managing activities, experiences and restaurant bookings with incredible efficiency and good humour.  Brilliant diving, snorkelling and dolphin watching with Anna and Kiah too.  The service, attention to detail and beautiful location made for a wonderful holiday."
"Was an absolutely brilliant trip all round! Ash, our GEM, was friendly and enormously helpful, the bikes we used to get around the island were adorable, the food and atmosphere were perfect. We had a wonderful time at Six Senses Laamu."
More than Six Senses ‚Ä¶  A sense of welcome A sense of pride A sense of hope Each day with the tide  A sense of nature A sense of calm A sense of protection With a unique charm  A sense of adventure A sense of sharing A sense of friendship Of nurture and caring  A sense of connection A sense of giving A sense of simplicity A new way of living  A sense of relaxing A sense of release A sense of breathing To bring inner peace  A sense of speed A sense of slow A sense of smiles Wherever you go  A sense of sun A sense of breeze A sense of freedom To feel at your ease  A sense of action A sense of quiet A sense of movement That feels just right  A sense of education A sense of learning A sense of fulfilment As each day is turning  A sense of wellness A sense of healing A sense of‚Ä¶
"Amazing experience. I really enjoyed my honeymoon over there, it has been an unforgettable experience. I would like to emphatize the amazing work of our GEM Stephany, that took care of every single detail of our time in Six Senses, making sure that every moment of our time there was perfect. I would like to thank also the gentle and kind waiter of the Chill Bar named Toto, that took care of us every time we stopped in the bar. To be honest, all the staff and workers of the resort were super nice, as I have never experienced before in any other hotel. Everything that we request or ask was always answered with a yes, they will always find a way to please you."
"Second time in laamu and probably not the last, definitely a trek to get there but very much worth it. The hotel setting is stunning, above and under the water. Kids 7,9,11 had the time of their lives  A special shout out to Tropic surf surf team travis, erin, cayman and saif who were amazing with my surfers, to Nik from diving center equally amazing with kids and to all the ladies at the kids club for all the fun for the kids!  We ll be back"
"We had a fantastic time at SixSenses Laamu. Couldn't ask fro more, form the outstanding service. First the staff, our GEM Gabriel was always looking out for us and helping with everything we might need. The same goes for all the rest of the staff, from the people at the dive shop to the sommelier.  And the place is fantastic. Amazing Villas, top notch snorkelling just jumping into the water from your villa, amazing diving (got to dive with a whole school of sharks which is what I love best) and amazing restaurants!! Looking forward to coming back!!"
"We had a fantastic time in Laamu, an absolute dream! Amazing staff everywhere that makes the stay absolutely unforgettable‚Ä¶ Surfing with Erin and Travis, dolphin cruise with 100 dolphins jumping around the boat, snorkeling just in front of the villa with turtles, rays and reef sharks, outstanding food, and so on‚Ä¶ one highlight chased the next. All on all a dream holiday!"
"Spent 5 days at Six Senses and it completely exceeded our expectations. The resort is outstanding, offering a great array of experiences you can enjoy or just relaxing in your own villa. Breakfast was a dream and restaurants offered the perfect food, direct from the resort own garden or local suppliers Ameen, our GEM, made sure our stay there was memorable, taking care of all our needs  Already dreaming of coming back!"
"Great island, great resort, great service and great activities. Diving was also amazing. The resort teams, all of them, are managing the experience to a high level, making anyone in Operations want to learn from how they get it done. Truly inspiring. "
"We came to Six Senses 2 years ago. Wonderful memories, fabulous food, incredible villa . The thing is with this resort is the magic ! Possibly our favourite place in the world only made better by the amazing staff who just can‚Äôt do enough to make your stay extra special.   Returning to Six Senses was like a reunion of family and friends. Such warmth. I might mention we were stuck on the island for a month during covid so really had the most amazing experience. Certainly qualified to write this review.   A special thanks to Aslah and the unforgettable Abdullah. Words cannot describe their friendliness, warm and genuine hospitality.   We will definitely be back !"
"I only have a few things to add to all the rave reviews already posted. First, the resort is stunningly beautiful and the healthy house reef and nearby diving is some of the best I have seen. There is so much to see whether you are snorkeling or diving. Next, the GEMs get a lot of press here and ours (Shah) was, besides being on top of and anticipating our requests, just a bright, kind, lovely presence throughout our  trip. Our scuba guide (Kush) was patient, informative, and just fun to talk to. Abida at the ice cream shop was full of stories and opinions about ice cream (Maldive Chili Chocolate!!) Finally, the relationship that Six Senses Laamu has with the co-located non-profits working on preservation and sustainability was an extra treat that satisfied our inner marine‚Ä¶"
I was at this resort for a family vacation and it was amazing. I was with my adult daughters .  The accommodations were outstanding.   We had a beach villa with a pool. The breakfast buffet is fantastic  My daughters got certified in scuba and we did a lot of scuba diving. It‚Äôs so beautiful there  We had a guest experience manager whose name was Ashraq. He made our trip so much more enjoyable. He always made sure we knew what the options were for the day He looked after us like we were family His level of service was the best I have  ever seen.  Thank you Ash  for making our trip Unforgettable.    I look forward to returning one day and I hope to see you again  We loved having you as our Guest experience manager
"We went to Six Senses Laamu for our children‚Äôs half term in October 2022; having seen it was voted into the top 10 hotels in the world in 2021 our expectations were extremely high - and we were not disappointed!  Starting with service: it was faultless across the board, so a big thank you to the whole team. In particular though, our GEM Ahmed Ath-har went above and beyond to ensure we had the perfect stay. From preempting I would be late for a spa appointment (because of an internal flight) and rescheduling it for me before we had even arrived, to arranging a babysitter in our villa at short notice, to ensuring we didn‚Äôt miss baby turtles hatching and making their way to the ocean (a real trip highlight) ...the list goes on. There was no request that he couldn‚Äôt deliver, with a‚Ä¶"
"After 6 weeks and over 40 hours of detailed research, we made the best decision on this resort and it FAR EXCEEDED our very high expectations.  We are a healthy, active, sporty laid back couple (41 and 37) that travels the world and we had a very specific wishlist for our 2 week honeymoon. If you‚Äôre looking for the following for your honeymoon, this is your place‚Ä¶..  - a HEALTHY HOUSE REEF with an abundant variety of species, turtles, rays, sharks, schools of reef fish, octopus, brilliant coral.   - a resort focused on CONSERVATION & SUSTAINABILITY. They don‚Äôt just talk the talk, they take sustainability to a whole new level! They have a dedicated team of marine biologists and conservationists (MUI) on site studying and educating guests during nightly talks as well as‚Ä¶"
"What a paradise!!!   Beauty + Relaxation + Plenty of activities for each member(s) of the family to enjoy every single minute.     Service impecable.   We were a big family group and two truly great G.E.M. (guest experience manager) Hamzath and Soba made sure any wish or need got organized and solved in a very personable and kindly way.    As area of improvement: many lunches and dinners were too slow, waiting time too long.   Thank you very much to all Six Senses team for the great experience."
"If you've ever wanted to go to the Maldives solo but hesitated due to its couples destination reputation, go to Six Senses. I almost canceled this trip after I recently broke up with my boyfriend and the thought of going alone seemed rather daunting, but I'm so glad I did it!   Not only is the resort stunning in all ways, the entire staff took care of me so well that I was happy to be there by myself! GEM Stephany, in particular, was exceptionally responsive and communicative, making my stay comfortable, joyous, and magical. She responded to every request and was never obtrusive. When I texted about a headache, a fresh coconut arrived at my villa shortly after, with the Maldivian equivalent of Tylenol. And chocolate cake surprise on my birthday! She helped organize activities‚Ä¶"
"We stayed 6 nights of our honey moon at six senses Laamu and it was perfect. Every detail was perfect, starting from sun rise to down. The food is excelente and has everything you could imagine and peeople are very kind there, always smiling and trying to give you the best experience . And our GEM Stephany is such an  amazing person, very  kind, and was 24/7 online to help us and giving great suggestion to us!   It was the best part of our honeymoom, we must go back to Laamu!"
We had the most amazing honeymoon trip at the Six Senses Resort. The water villa was very comfortable and charming. Food was excellent. Staff members were very friendly and helpful. Our GEM Amsood was spot on. Always willing to help and accommodated us. Wish we could stay longer!
"We are a couple from Las Vegas who place travel at the top of our priority list.  As such, we have been to some of the most incredible resorts in the world and experiences some amazing hospitality.  Our trip to the Maldives and our stay at Six Senses Laamu has become our favorite travel experience.  It started when the General Manager Marteen and her staff were present to greet us as we arrived at Laamu.  We were introduced to the key staff members of the resort and our Guest Experience Maker Shah (Ahmed Shah).  Shah proceeded to be our main contact for the duration of our trip and there was nothing he could not assist with.  The over-water villas were incredible!  The spa was beautiful, relaxing and an oasis in itself.  The restaurants and the food were delectable.  However,‚Ä¶"
"We had an amazing time during our stay.  The whole staff is very kind, always trying to make us comfortable during our stay; food is great and the place is a paradise.  We went for scuba diving with Nick, who took us on a beautiful marine tour around the island .  It was incredible !"
"OVERALL: Very nicely located hotel with amazing villas and extremely helpful and friendly staff!  HOTEL OUTDOORS- outstanding!.  HOTEL INDOORS- very comfortable villas with private pool and very private  STAFF- very friendly and professional!! Cheers to Ahmed ( 6 stars out of 5, GEM).  FOOD- extremely well prepared food with options for every taste and allergies  PRICE- you don‚Äôt go to paradise for nothingüòù"
"We where one week on the six sense Laamu for our honey moon and it was completely amazing, the hotel is beautiful, the food is incredible, everything was well organised clean and in perfect conditions. But the best of the best from the hotel is the crew there where all the time with a smile, all the time taking care of you and of your 5 star experience. If you choose six sense laamu for your trip trust me you will know that you have made the perfect choice as soon as you will arrive, the only thing bad that I can say from the hotel is that I had to leave... Best regards and congratulations for all the crew, you are the best!"
"We had the most incredible stay at Six Senses Laamu at the end of November.  It is literally heaven on earth.  Total paradise.    The villa - a Sunset Lama Overwater Villa on Jetty A was perfect.  The view from the room was idyllic looking straight out over the turquoise water to the house reef which was within metres.  The bed and day beds were so comfortable and the house keeping was immaculate.    The staff were all exceptional - always smiling and able to help with any query.  I have to mention Ash our GEM.  He was the kindest, most helpful and smiliest.  Nothing was too much trouble and he made our stay great every day.  Everything from making restaurant bookings to organising the most incredible sunset dolphin safari where we there was a pod of 100 spinner dolphins...‚Ä¶"
"Magic stay ! From the experiences offered as the different kind of yoga, the tasting menu at Leaf Restaurant, the variety of choice for breakfast, the kindness of the hosts, all was faultless. Our favorite: being barefoot the whole stay, move around by bike, the sustainability tour, the Spa & Wellness area. A special thank you to our incredible GEM, Gabriel Styger, always smiling and caring. Perfect property for couples who want to reconnect and for families with children has they have Villas with 2 bedrooms. We hope to be able to return, one day to this very well managed property by GM, Marteyne.  "
"From adventures into relaxing ,snorkeling, family time. SixSenses laamu is the best place to stay for body and mind reset. They also have the best staff ever! Thank you again for making us feel so welcome!"
"Absolutely wonderful stay at Laamu! The service was top notch and we thing was amazing. We loved our GEM, Amsood. Upon arriving he has pre booked all our dinners which was nice to have (and also flexible if we changed our minds). The snorkeling was incredible, so much to see! My husband is a surfer, and despite there not being tons of swell the people at Tropic Surf were amazing. Highly recommend!"
"It was our first time at Six Senses Laamu and we left one piece of our hearts there. The resort is amazing and we really loved the concept of Eco-Sustainability which is really appreciable.   On our arrival we recieved a very warm welcome from the Manager and all the staff which was really nice and unique.   But the best thing on arrival was taking off our shoes and walking barefoot (for the whole week!). It made for a stronger connection with the earth and the nature.   I decided to improve my skills in scuba diving during our stay in SSL and I had the best dive instructor ever, NICHOLAOS, who not only made me feel confident but defenitely increased my motivation to continue to dive and to grow.  The food and its quality was amazing and so fresh.    SSL provides so many healthy‚Ä¶"
"We loved Six Senses Laamu!!  We already knew de SIx Senses Douro Valley and Ibiza and all three are amazing! This is a nice brand!!! Our beach villa was gorgeous, huge and very private! We loved the concept of this resort, barefoot all the time, even in the Evening, wonderful healthy food, amazing spa and wellness workshops. Everyday there are lots os activities to choose from: from wellness workshops, to snorkeling, coconut oil making, Pilates, facial yoga, sunset cruises, dolphins cruises, evening talks about the community, cinema under the stars‚Ä¶. Loads & loads of very interesting activities to choose from. Many of them are complimentary. The spa massages and treatments are 5 stars as well as the therapists.

"The best part of this year for me would have to be our stay at Six Senses Laamu. We received exceptional care from our GEM Shah, making our trip even more special. His availability and willingness to assist us in any way made this trip even more special. He was always just a call or text away. We would especially like to thank Marteyne for making this trip possible and Mode for ensuring that it went perfectly for us.  Can't wait to visit again!"
From arrival till departure Six Senses Laamu showed us the best of Maldives. Highlight of our visit would be foods offered in four different restaurants with insanely gorgeous views.  Special shoutout to our GEM Shah for his kindness and enthusiasm and showing us around the resort. Very special thanks to Mode for always checking on us.  We surely will miss the hospitality Six Senses Laamu offered and hope to visit soon.  
"Heaven on earth, complete paradise, the design, service, food, all in all a level above any other. The staff are very special, the management should be proud of themselves & their teams, for they have created something only dreams are made of, there are not words available to explain just how special this trip was & how they looked after us, it‚Äôs life changing!!!  All other destinations/venues will struggle to to satisfy after this trip, but it‚Äôs worth it‚Ä¶.

"Six Senses Laamu was an absolute dream. The team at the resort is second to none, and really look after you. The food was incredible, the villas stunning, and the surfing and diving divine. Our stay surpassed all our expectations. Erin, Travis, Cayman and Saif from the surf shop were lovely, and really invested in taking time to show me surf tips, take videos and walk me through what I had to do to improve. I‚Äôll forever be thinking of Erin when I do my pop ups now, she‚Äôs such an incredible coach. Cayman also fixed my board without me asking, after it arrived with a few dings and dents from the airport. Our GEM, Amsood, was thoughtful and kind and even organised some surprises for us. Fantastic diving, and the team at MUI give some of the best marine biology talks I have ever‚Ä¶"
"My wife and I just spent 8-nights at the Six Senses in the Maldives celebrating a 15-year anniversary. We're from Southern California, so it was a really journey to get there, but well worth it.   The staff was amazing with a particular shout out to our Guest Experience Manager, Amsood, and Erin/Travis from Tropic Surf.  I'm an avid surfer and I was blown away by the quantity of empty, local surf spots (Petros, Ying-Yangs, Jetty C) within a 5-10 minute boat ride. The Tropic Surf team was really helpful and friendly. It felt like I was surfing with friends from home rather than a chartered boat.   Highly recommend visiting for the location, experience & world class surf!"
"After a 4hr 15min plane ride from Singapore we landed in Mal√©, excited for our long-awaited dream holiday - the one that‚Äôs been on my bucket list for the last 10 years! We were greeted at the airport by Six Senses staff and escorted to the lounge where we waited roughly 2-ish hrs for a 30 minute domestic flight to Kadhdhoo island where we then boarded a speedboat for a 20 minute ride to Laamu. On arrival, we were met by Marteyne who had gathered her team to welcome us. We were introduced to our GEM, Gabriel who was assigned to look after us over the next 5-days. Gabriel took us on a quick tour around the island, introducing the various facilities and dining locations and got us set up in our over-water villa. Just within the first hour and we were already regretting that we only‚Ä¶"
"My wife and I spent weeks trying to pick our honeymoon destination and not once we regretted our decision to stay at Six Senses Laamu! We travelled almost 20 hours to get there, but knew it was worth it the moment we set foot on this beautiful island.  We stayed 2 nights in the beachfront villa, and 3 nights in the overwater villa.  The beach villa was almost mystical, completely surrounded by trees, with a small path leading to the beach, where we would watch the sun set over the Indian Ocean. And the upper terrace was perfect for stargazing at night! The overwater villa was also beyond what we'd expected. We stayed at the end of Jetty B. There was a small coral reef just few meters off our villa for us to explore every day, and patches of seagrass a little further out where we‚Ä¶"
"From the moment you are met at the airport and taken onto the launch to go to the island, the Six Senses experience begins with the initial invitation to remove your shoes. It‚Äôs such a subtle thing and yet defines the whole experience. You immediately feel relaxed and grounded. We were then warmly welcomed onto the island itself by a whole team including our GEM (General experience manager) who looked after us the whole time.   Everyone and everything is a perfect balance of ‚Äòdown-to-earth luxury‚Äô and professionalism and thankfully there is no bling.   The brochure looks idyllic and yet doesn‚Äôt  do justice to the resort or the rooms, the reality is so much better than I had imagined. There is so much space there is real feeling of freedom, unlimited access to the sea and reefs‚Ä¶"
It was amazing time for us. We came here 20 Nov 2022 at night. All staffs are so hospitality and kind. Especially Mr.Ashraq is the greatest GEM I've ever met. The facilities were so nice and cozy! I recommend Six Senses Laamu 120%!! You can also experience many programs in the Island! I'll never foget these memories :) Thanks!
"the Six Senses resort is a perfect resort with fantastic natural view, good quality food and warm staff , everything is perfect here;  The sea is crystal clear and the coral is well protected, we can snorkeling is under the resort ;  The food is served with good quality, there are various restaurants available, especially the leaf restaurant is well designed by its natural harmony concept ;  The kids club Den is kids‚Äô paradise , my sons visited the Den by themselves once they are free, the colorful activities and educational lectures are welcomed by  the kids;  The most precious factor of sis senses is the warming staff, a GEM will take care of your stay in the resort, makes your trip easy and hassle free.We are lucky that we are cared by Mr Ashraq, who is very helpful and warm‚Ä¶"
"It‚Äòs like being in paradies :-) Great service, excellent food and massages. Very peaceful and the best marine life just in front of our ocean villa. We saw huge turtles, very cute eagle rays, cow tail rays and big colourful fishes. On top of all, Gabriel, our GEM, made our holiday. Always there to fulfil our wishes, very nice and professional. Thanks a lot! We will be back for sure :-)"
This was my 3th visit at this resort. And again it was absolutely fantastic. After my last stay (2014) they build a fabulous swimmingpool and relax area at the resort named Sip Sip where you can enjoy the pool and have lunch in a nice cosy admosphere overlooking the pool and ocean. The perfection and level of quality is best in the business. The clear waters and extensive dive opportunities make this resort in my opinion the best resort ever visited
"It was fantastic. When we arrive by plane,  the people from six senses were waiting for us and help us to the boat.  Laamu six senses was amazing. It was beautiful and  clean, very good breakfast. The diners were tasteful and delicious. The GEM was fantastic and friendly. All the staff was friendly. Thx for all!  GM , Marteyne, thx for all !  Compliments! Best resort in Malediven. "

"We just returned from 7 days at Six Senses at Laamu in the Maldives.‚Ä®Weather was average with some amazing days and some rainy days but that is out of everybody's control, nevertheless it was still beautiful, rain, hail or shine. ¬†Our GEM (guest experience manager)Gabriel was nothing short of outstanding. Always there to help without getting in the way. His English was good, precise in his descriptions and overall helped with absolutely everything we needed. Being a highly sustainable 5 star resort we joined a sustainability tour in which a lovely lady named Leasha was our guide for the 60 minutes it took. She was truly magnificent in her job, nothing was to hard and she took the time to explain all the points that were of interest to us both. She knew every detail of the island‚Ä¶"
"WOW. It almost doesn‚Äôt seem right to summarize this experience in a single review. My wife and I stayed at Six Senses Laamu for two weeks during our honeymoon, and we both agreed it was the greatest resort experience of our lives thus far. After months of research, involving over 100 different resorts, we landed on this one and began the trip with the highest of expectations. This experience, the quality of every element of the resort, the beauty of the location, the laid-back casual but elevated feel, and the incredible staff surpassed those expectations by far. In an effort to keep this relatively concise, I‚Äôll try to touch on the components that stood out the most, although we have nearly zero areas for improvement.  It must begin with the staff, who were incredibly‚Ä¶"
"Jolly agreeable resort. They do actually have a barefoot approach (I wondered if it was just marketing...but it wasn't) and it makes for a very low key unpretentious feel. If you like getting a bit glam and sticking a hermes bag under your arm this probably isn't the right resort for you. Our guest experience manager was a gem. Really helpful and attentive, almost creepy how she knew what we were doing all the time, I loved it. Awesome house reef and sea grass meadow, I met a wild turtle on my own whilst our snorkeling, I think it's fair to say that neither of us will ever forget each other.  The sea villa/hut on poles is very spacious and the upper seating deck is a nice little bonus area.  As for the negatives...it is a bit annoying having to wait for your internal transfer‚Ä¶"
"We‚Äôve just arrived back from Six Senses  resort in the Maldives - I felt compelled to leave a small review, as I generally never do so. But the experience we received  far outmatched by our high expectations prior to departure; it truly is a paradise to be experienced. As a result I will also seek out more Six Senses experiences in the future as I was thoroughly impressed with their offering. The whole experience was spearheaded by amazing staff with particular mention to our GEM Ash who looked after us from the moment we arrived.  Ray, Molly & Saffron"
"This hotel is the best hotel in the Maldives. Located in the Central Atolls, it is an easy domestic flight from Male and a short speedboat. The barefoot beautiful grounds, the friendly staff and the fantastic manager, Martyne made my experience just all-time. The emphasis on well being was so fantastic from the healthy fresh menu, the spa, the pillow type selection in your room and most importantly the adherence and respect to sustainability. As a surfer, I found the Surf Guides at Tropic Surf - Erin and Travis to be in class on famiiarity with waves, safety and most importantly the fun factor. This place was just comfortable, felt like home and all of the guests were friendly and interesting from different backgrounds. I cant wait to visit this place again. This is the only‚Ä¶"
"We could stay almost one week in Six Senses Laamu. It was such a dream! We will definitely go back and hopefully have, once again, Gabriel as our GEM. Thanks to his support and kindness, we could enjoy the resort and discover all Maldives‚Äô treasures! THANK YOU!!!"
"My husband and I arrived in Mal√© for our honeymoon and we‚Äôre greeting at the airport by Six Senses staff who escorted us to the lounge to await our seaplane ride to a local island. We were then picked up and taken by boat to the most incredible resort I have ever seen, on the island of Laamu. We were kindly greeted by the manager, Patrick and our GEM, Shah. Shah took us on a tour of the island and got us set up in the villa. Throughout our 7 days here, Shah has gone above and beyond to make this trip the most memorable one. He arranged our excursions and activities, is available promptly and does everything with true Maldivian joy! Our experience here would not have been what it was without Shah. I got coral rash and Shah made sure to have the island nurse check me out so I was‚Ä¶"
"Such and amazing trip! Six Senses more than exceed my expectations for our stay.   We arrived in the evening to the local airport in Mal√© and were met with representatives from the resort. We waited in the lounge for till check in and after a quick Island plane flight we arrived to an adjacent island. Our bags were picked up and we walked across the parking lot to a speed boat which took us to Laamu.   We arrived to the most wonderful welcome when we met Shah our GEM and he did such an incredible job helping us with everything we needed. He made every possible effort to make our trip such an incredible one.  He was very expedient in communicating with us about our itinerary, any changes and always gave the best recommendations for each meal. He was always so kind and went above‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses Laamu is definetly the most magical, unique place on Earth with this special indescribable energy which makes you feel like you‚Äôre in another dimension. The goals of sustainability and connecting to the planet, by being barefoot or the strong focus on marine biology research and education. The coral reef and sea grass meadows located in the resort allows you to see the most insanely beautiful marine life and coral structures. The whole Marine Biology Team is very passionate and encouraged for you to gain knowledge and see the secrets of the ocean, Greg, Sarah, Kiah, Julian, Jess and many more have brought me and my family a fun and educational experience on the daily house reef snorkels and evening talks.

"Paradise. In every single way. I don't know where to start, but since we stepped foot into the boat to take us to the island we were looked after so much, genuinely cared for and provided the best service. When you see the island it's special, but when you get in your villa (especially over water) and you realise how beautiful the place is, and the room... it takes your breath away. Pictures do not do justice to what SS have achieved here.   The staff are so attentive, friendly and go above and beyond. Our GEM Amsood is a legend, we are so grateful for him, for the help, the advice and the conversations! He's a real star. Everyone we spoke to was so kind and would always say hello and chat, we learnt so much about the island and the Maldives in general.   The environmental‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses is a magical place. From the moment one sets foot on the island, the magic begins. We loved the sustainability focus and eco-friendly approach which is rare to see in most resorts. All guests are assigned GEMs who organize every activity throughout you stay. Ours was Ash and he was always accomodating and smiling. We stayed at the ocean villa which had so much space and a private beach in front of it. The food was amazing. All ingredients were fresh. One has option to try different cuisines everyday. We would definitely come back to this paradise."
"We're just back from a fabulous 7 night stay at this real gem of a hotel. We've been to many a smart hotel over the years but Six Senses Laamu has pushed the bar very high indeed. So many reasons for this...from the genuine focus on sustainability from the MUI (Maldives Underwater Initiative) team to the hotel's superb smoothies at breakfast and the quality ingredients that go into each food option. The sea life around the hotel is teeming with all kinds of tropical fish but much more than that, it becomes an everyday experience to see a turtle feeding in the seagrass or a ray nestling into the white sand. Unbelievable! Seeing such creatures in abundance within an untouched natural habitat is very special indeed. We stayed at one of the stilted villas on jetty A  facing the‚Ä¶"
"We recently stayed at this unique island in the Maldives that far exceeded our expectations.  The extraordinary sea life was a thrill every day.  We saw green turtles from our water villa deck every day, literally meters away. Each time we snorkelled we always saw something either in the sea grass area or the house reef which was like swimming through Finding Nemo film!. Eagle rays, cow tail rays as well as all manner of fish, big and small.  The resort has a well staffed and established marine conservation team who we snorkelled with and went to their talks on various things which really enhanced our appreciation and understanding of what we saw. Shout out to Sarah who lent me her snorkel whilst out as mine started to fall. which meant I could continue with the swim. The dive‚Ä¶"
"My husband and I celebrated our honeymoon in an overwater pool villa for 8 days. The experience was second to none - literally from stepping off the plane in Male. Our guest experience maker Ashraq played a significant part in making our stay as wonderful as it was - he was friendly, flexible and always two steps ahead, always anticipating our needs before us. The quality and cleanliness of the villas and entire resort is faultless and staff are all so friendly and welcoming. Food and beverages were all top class. I highly recommend doing a half board option as individual prices of meals can become extremely expensive otherwise. The day spa experience was also a highlight. Thank you Six senses for making our honeymoon so special - we will be back to celebrate our anniversary!‚Ä¶"
"We've just come back from our 10 day trip to this Paradise. This resort is a great choice and surely worth visiting. The territory is amazing. Though it can host a very big number of guests, you almost most of the time feel like an uninhabited island. The food is amazing - super breakfast with a la carte menu and delicious cheese and charcuterie room, great buffet dinners, Lobster dinner. the Leaf restaurant is the best gastronomic experience. We have also booked a wine dinner with sommelier and that was fantastic. Sommelier is a big professional and an interesting story-teller. Actually all of the staff are so nice and friendly, always willing to help. Spa center is great. A lot of water activities. Villas are very spacious and nicely designed.

"I could not recommend Six Senses more highly - not just for the unbelievable setting, first class food every night and incredible sea life, but for the staff. Our GEM, Shah, made our visit extra special - going above and beyond at every turn predicting our wants and needs before we‚Äôd even thought of them. He organised a great itinerary with incredibly attentive and thoughtful detail.   Our stay felt both private and authentic rather than cliche and we loved being able to jump into the water (without an organised trip) and immediately see incredible fish, turtles, sting rays and even sharks! If you want all the magic of the Maldives from people that care - this is it. Cx"
"Our honeymoon at Six Senses Laamu was absolutely amazing!  We were greeted by a Six Senses rep at Male international airport who then guided us through onto our domestic connection.  Upon arrival at the resort our Guest Experience Maker Ashraq greeted us and then provided a thorough tour of the island before dropping us at our villa.  Ashraq had already come up with a dinner itinerary for our stay and was extremely helpful when we requested changes. Overall he was a pleasure to deal with and ensured that our experience was unforgettable.  The culinary experience at the resort was absolutely amazing, with numerous options available to suit all preferences.  Six Senses sustainable approach to high end tourism was both refreshing and sincere, we will definitely visit more Six‚Ä¶"
"The level of service and thought was nothing short of exceptional. Met by the resort rep in Male, escorted through domestic flight to Olhuveli Island and onto the resort itself was very smooth and professional. The greeting on arrival was really nice and made us feel at home.  We were looked after by Ashraq our guest experience maker, who made our trip the best it could have been. His attention to detail was second to none and helped us with any queries we had.  The ocean water villa we were in was amazing with everything thought of from bicycles with our initials on to an updated activities list from daily yoga, waterspor tand dining.

I would like to say thank you to our GEM Ashraq who looked after us perfectly, his knowledge, helpfulness and professionalism throughout made our holiday, we loved his personality always with that wonderful smile! The lady at the ice cream bar was superb, so was Shugar the bar tender at Chill, Jason at Sip Sip, Phillip one of the managers, Khush the scuba instructor, and Marteyne the GM‚Ä¶.

"The resort itself is simply incredible! It is peaceful, calming, restoring and I must add the food and service is amazing! Staff members were super polite and pleasant. Ashraq was with us the whole time and made sure we had the best experience 24/7.  We hope to come back next year with our little one. Thank you Six Senses Laamu for giving us the best time!"
"1. Exceptional service, especially with our GEM (guest experience maker), our own private concierge (1 per 6 villa) took care of our activities and made sure we were taken care of at every turn.  We had Ashraq (Ash) who is awesome!!! Can‚Äôt say enough nice things about him. The General Manager Marteyne sets the tone. She‚Äôs friendly, professional and respected by all.  2. Food is outstanding!! From private wine dinners to lobster night to customized breakfasts, everything was delicious and beautifully presented.

One of the things that impressed is the most is that each couple has a dedicated guest personal concierge that organizes all the activities and make the experience even smoother.

Special mention must be made of our GEM, Ath-har. Being taken care of by him was an unexpected delight, and really added to the enjoyment of our holiday.  We loved the snorkelling and whilst visiting the house reef saw turtles, rays, sharks and an octopus.

"From the beginning of trip we were made to feel at home with excellent care and attention to our needs.  Our relationship manager Amsood, throughout the trip was able to make everyone feel extremely comfortable, arrange all of our activities and was much more than a relationship manager, Amsood was an extremely good friend.  He was also able to help with late flight changes and was always there to help whenever it was needed and also more importantly to make sure we were enjoying our vacation and everything was running smootly.  Also a big shout out goes out to the whole diving team - it was simply fantastic to dive with such a friendly team.  Thank you to everyone at Six Senses Laamu for an amazing life experience and hand on heart i can not recommend Six Senes enough!"
"As I had promised to Ameen, our wonderful Guest Experience Maker (GEM), I am writing this review. This is a long review to be thorough, but the example I detail in the second paragraph will give you a general idea of their service if you don't want to read so much. I want to start with a big thank you to Ameen. Since the moment we arrived until the day we left and every moment in between that we needed him, he took care of us in the most attentive and professional way, always with a smile. He arranged all our dinner reservations and coordinated them with our other activities, he reorganized our dinner times again after I asked him we wanted to dine later so we could watch the sunset from our villa, he picked us up for dinner and drove us on the buggy on a night that was raining,‚Ä¶"
"From our arrival to the time we departed, we experienced world class services.  The GEM programme of allocation of a dedicated person 24x7 for all our needs was reflective of the attentive personalised butler type services.  The quality and range of food was excellent and by far the best we have experienced in our multiple experiences in the Maldives over 25 years. They took great care to ensure our needs were met. One small hick-up at Happy Hour mid week could not change our opinion of the overall experiences.   This location was chosen for the scuba diving and a separate review has been submitted.  We would plan to revisit again and maybe also experience the newly planned Six Senses. "
"I had an amazing week at the Six Senses Laamu. The staff were incredibly friendly, professional and went out of their way to make sure we had an enjoyable time. Amsood was our GEM and he was very accommodating from day one ensuring every member of my family had a great experience in Laamu. We had an incredible family  anti-gravity yoga session with Hemant Singh who is an amazing teacher and incredibly passionate and gifted. The staff at the bars, restaurants, spas and throughout the island were very friendly and made our time at the Six Senses unforgettable. "
"We had an amazing time at the Sixth Senses Laamu. One if the best resorts in the Maldives. The staff were absolutely amazing. Very personalised experience. The food was absolutely delicious and everything we wanted that was not on the menu was catered for us.  Diving was amazing and my family really enjoyed it.  Spa and Yoga were excellent.  Amsood was our GEM and we were all looked after very very well by him.  Patrick, Hemant, Khoyode, Helen, Riza, Lawrence, Abida, etc and compliments to all the chefs there. They were amazing.

"This would have to be the most luxurious and relaxing holiday we have ever had. It will likely spoil any future adventures by comparison. Six senses go out of their way to hit every single Mark as a five star destination. We would like to especially mention Amsood, our guest experience manager for making sure that everything was perfect at all times.  I everything from bedlinen to the range of muesli at breakfast had been considered. The cuisine was world-class, as was the service and general attitude of everybody there from the moment we stepped foot onto the speedboat to go to the island, to the moment we left."
"We have just returned from an amazing family holiday to Six Senses, this gorgeous resort has all the wow factor and will leave you with lasting memories. We travelled as a family of 5 and had 2 overwater villas. The villas are beautiful, complete with outdoor shower, glass bottom bath and direct access to the clear warm water. The villas are serviced twice daily and any additional requests are never too much trouble. Our GEM Amsood was fantastic. He greeted us on our arrival and was so friendly, charismatic and helpful.

When we arrived on the island, we were greeted by our GEM Ainura who went above and beyond throughout our stay to make sure we were happy and comfortable. Six Senses Laamu is very passionate about sustainability which was a fantastic incentive since generally the Maldives' islands are struggling to maintain a more eco-friendly way of life. This in itself made me fall in love with the place. Not to mention our out of this world overwater villa on Jetty A next to the sea grass where we saw green turtles every single day!

From the moment we stepped off the boat to the dock we felt the resort gave us a very personalised experience.

"Six Senses Laamu is the perfect honeymoon destination, my wife and I could not have asked for a better experience.   Location and transport: The resort requires both a domestic flight from Male to Kadhoo airport and then a speedboat transfer. While this might seem like a hassle compared to a direct seaplane flight, the advantage is that your arrival and departure times are not limited to day time hours as with resorts that use seaplanes. On our final day, our international flight home departing Male was late at night and the resort graciously granted us checkout at 6pm, effectively giving us another full day in paradise!   Room: We stayed in a Laamu water villa, an overwater villa located roughly halfway down the pier facing the east. The villa itself was massive, the bed‚Ä¶"
"Ashraq, thank you so much for the wonderful week!! We had such a good time in Six Senses Laamu and partly was thanks to you. All the organization was perfect!! We loved the concept of the hotel, you are doing an amazing job  To the best GEM - Ashraq - THANK YOU!!!!!"
"We spent the end of the honeymoon at the six sense lamuu hotel and it has been a wonderful experience. The incredible hotel, the super attentive staff and there is a calm all the time, perfect for resting body and mind. Marvelous! We can't make any negative comments, since everything has been perfect. We carry out diving and fishing activity, and both are highly recommended."
"It was the best experience in my life! I chose the resort very carefully, it was important to be far from Male (so that there was no reminder of civilization around), the live reef, delicious food, a good spa, the abundance of water and beach villas and big green island. Based on these criteria, I chose Six Senses Laamu and I‚Äôm very pleased with the choice. We spent 5 days at the Laamu water villa and 5 days at the ocean beach villa. Both are amazing, worth a try, but be sure to grab one of the laamu to add more privacy and deep enough ocean for swimming. Beach villas provide ultimate privacy and vast grounds! Both villas have absolutely everything you need and much more, even their own music for meditation and incense.. Food at the hotel is a separate part of the pleasure.‚Ä¶"
"My hubby and I have spent 5 days in Six Senses Laamu to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The surroundings, the villa, the food and the people are really amazing. As we visited Maldives during the monsoon season, we kind of mentally prepared that it may rain most of the time. But fortunately, we did enjoy 3 sunny days though. Lucky us :)    As the resort is built around the nature, it really gives me a very relaxing and healing senses when staying there. The water around is crystal clear. The moment you just step out of the villa and immerge yourself into the water with the snorkeling gear, you can already see the beautiful corals, seagrass, marine animals down under.  Thanks to our ""Guest Experience Maker"" Ashraq, he did a great deal to make our trip worry-free. With his‚Ä¶"
"When my wife and I decided to come to Maldives for holiday, we have taken some time to choose which resort to stay with by watching YouTubes and looking others' reviews. After a tough selection, we finally decided to come to Six Senses to to celebrate our anniversary. Believe it or not, I would say the surroundings and experiences are much better than what seen on YouTubes. The resort itself is not only surrounded by nature but merged itself into it. The island, the restaurants, the villa and even the pathways are all surrounded by green bluish water. Not sure if we were lucky, we had encountered the eagle rays  twice and a baby shark when walking on the path along the shore.  The water villa we stayed is another highlight. I really love that almost everything in the villa is‚Ä¶"
"Our stay at six senses was amazing! We saw so much aquatic life in the surrounding reef and the service by our ""guest experience manager"", Shah was unparalleled. Shah was always willing to do everything possible to make our stay more comfortable and even helped us do a photoshoot for my wife's instagram!  Thank you, Shah! And thanks to everyone at Six Senses :)  Also, Shah is a master henna tattoo artist and is happy to give you a henna tattoo! I got a mantaray!"
"Wow... where to begin! We chose to spend our honeymoon at Six Senses Laamu because of their commitment to the environment and their sustainable practices. This hotel is a true eco-paradise. We spent our days surrounded by the stunning ocean, beautiful nature and vibrant wildlife. The very first night we got there, we saw 3 eagle rays swimming beneath us at the restaurant. I really enjoyed the fact that they organize environmental talks almost every night. I learned a lot about sharks, manta rays and the importance of coral during those wonderful chats provided by the hotel's amazing team of marine biologists. Our GEM, Shah, was just incredible! He made our trip 1000x better. He was always looking out for us, making sure we had everything we needed and lighting up our day with a‚Ä¶"
"Having stayed at Six Senses, Laamu last year we were keen to return, and the property again exceeded all our expectations. I love the Robinson Crusoe style, which the resort does with effortless ease. Reclaimed wood, thatched roofs, no shoes, this is eco-relaxing at its most refined. However, it is the service that really stands out, with a special mention for Ainura who, as last year, made our stay seemlessly enjoyable. Note that there is some construction/upgrades going on, but disturbances are keep to the absolute minimum and we look forward to visiting the new eco centre and observatory next year. Supper at Leaf was the standout meal this time - make sure you go for the local fish."
everything is beautiful like a paradise Everyone is so professional. So warm. Food is delicious. We have the best housekeeper Must come once in a lifetime. If you come to Maldives. This is the best choice
"The perfect holiday, beautiful island, attentive service, it is a good memory that I can't bear to leave. I will always remember this wonderful time. I also thank the housekeeper for the dedicated service to make this holiday even more perfect. Thank you I love SIX SENSES LAAMU"
"Six Senses Laamu is one of the best resorts we have ever been to. It is beautiful to see and even more beautiful to experience. Aside from the stunning beauty, the staff of this resort is amazing. From the grounds staff to the management; everyone is kind and engaging. The food choices were vast and delicious. The snorkeling was awesome. We saw lots of sea life just feet from our villa. The massages at the spa make you melt away. It‚Äôs the total package for rest, relaxation and enjoying the ocean. The whole experience is brought together by your GEM. Ours was Ashraq.

"My husband, 19 year old daughter and I have just visited SSL for 9 amazing days and nights. It was our second visit (the first having been in 2015) and in the interim we have visited 4 other (mainly 5 star) Maldivian resorts. SSL is definitely our favourite.  THE ROOM We stayed in an Ocean Beach Pool Villa (no. 93). The design of the room is superb and completely in keeping with the Maldivian vibe and the ethos of the resort. Very luxurious but low key. Nothing is ostentatious but all beautifully thought out and stylishly executed. Immensely comfy bed and extensive pillow menu - we slept very  well. They made up the daybed for my daughter and she said it was very comfy, but a bit short (she is 5‚Äô9‚Äù). The bathroom is gorgeous and accessible from the outside as well as from the‚Ä¶"
"The staff and environment was fantastic. The food every night was diverse and was excellent. We had a guest experience maker (GEM), Ashraq, who helped to make the whole stay even better and smoother. He booked all the restaurants, events and assisted in planning the day out for us. We were given his contact and he offered assistance no matter what time in the day or night. The overall experience was fantastic and I couldn‚Äôt recommend it enough!"
"Our villa was kept amazingly with amenities that were down to every detail, from music speakers, toiletries, to wet bags to use if you leave the resort with wet clothes. Six Senses also has a very strong sense of sustainability and the island also has constant educational talks about marine life, which made the vacation both enjoyable and educational.  The staff were very friendly and responsive. Several members of staff would approach us as we were enjoying our meals to catch up on what we did during the day and to ask if we needed anything.   I would especially highlight our very personal interaction and the professionalism of our Guest Experience Maker, Ashraqu, who made sure he assisted in every step of our time at Six Senses Laamu.

"Be absolutely impressed by the Six Senses, Laamu! Where Aslah, Faarish and Adam were gracious hosts with loads of patience & knowledge to impart. Will definitely return to see how they‚Äôd grown hand-in-hand with their community!"
"Came here for a family holiday as a group of 9 and we were very well taken care for by our GEM, Aslah. He had no trouble meeting our requests and was extremely accommodating when it came to arranging our group activities. We especially appreciate the complimentary bubblies and sunset cruises when we couldn‚Äôt see any dolphins.   Our housekeeping staff, Aiman, was amazing as well. We‚Äôd always come back to our room with our clothes nicely folded and the turn down service was a blessing at the end of a tiring day.   Although the service attitude of a few other staff members could be better, it was generally a very pleasant vacation."
"Aslah, the GEM is very friendly and take great care during our stay. We enjoyed the stay very much and impressed with the sustainable initiatives the resort committed. I love the bicycle ride around the island and shoeless feelings , back to nature and really feel very relax throughout my vacation at Six Senses."
Beautiful villa and excellent hospitality  from all the staffs. From the first steps till the last steps here we were treated as vip. Our room was so well taken care. Foods were excellent. I will definitely visit again.   Thanks Six Senses‚Äôs staffs.
"Excellent GEM , making sure our trip is memorable !   Aslah was a great GEM and made sure our trips was all planned out and with good recommendations !

"Amazing resort that has given lots of unforgettable memories.   We opted for the half board package and everything was arranged very well by our Guest Experience Maker (GEM). Look for Aslah, very accommodating for every request we made.   Villas were top notch! Rooms were made twice daily, and they even took it the extra mile by folding our clothes and putting them aside. Aiman was the person in charge for our villa and he did a great job.   Best part was, we could even see turtles, reef sharks and eagle rays right outside our villa! Just had to jump in once we caught sight of them.   Just a couple of complaints, the ice cream lady seemed a little rude and grumpy. Other than that, everything was üëçüèº"

"An amazing second trip to Six Senses Laamu  ! We came back for the fantastic diving with Deep Blue Divers, the flawless service and lovely food !   All of the dive team took such good care of us and were always so accommodating, planning out the best dive sites and ensuring we could return to any favourites.  We loved hearing about all of the sustainability efforts and Manta briefings from Jinaad too !  My sister also did her first ever dive & open water with Danny & loved it. üëå  Ameen our GEM was brilliant, taking great care of all of our plans and sharing info & history about Laamu and the Maldives.

"I had the opportunity to spend eight days in Laamu during August. The purpose of the trip was to reconnect with myself and two dear friends. From the outset, we were greeted by the wonderful Six Senses Laamu staff who welcomed us when we arrived by boat. In addition to some of the staff, we were introduced to our Guest Experience Maker (GEM) Ashraq. From that day on, Ashraq guided us as we planned our itinerary which ranged from a dolphin sunset cruise, snorkeling, a wonderful wine tasting dinner and simply vegging out pool side.   The island's natural beauty and marine life is incomparable. The villas are so well appointed, idyllic and somehow grand in their simplicity. I am beyond impressed by how beautiful and unique the total landscape is. The food is spectacular with a‚Ä¶"
"This was my third visit to Six Senses Laamu, I really find this place amazing and keep coming back. The environment, the sustainable conscience, the unbelievable and diverse food, the snorkeling, the massages, the top-notch quality of the rooms and service. It is really impossible to describe in words the full experience. But I can certainly say, if you are trying to decide where to go, look no further, this is the place, I promise."
"It became a yearly pilgrimage for my wife and me. Since we went for the first time we have been returning on the same week every year. It is hard not to use the word ""experience"" as going to SS Laamu is way beyond vacationing. Aslah, our GEM, is simply one of the best human beings out there. Food is incomparable. Leaf, the fine dining restaurant runs head to head with any Michelin starred venue in the USA. Spa treatment, villa cleanliness, privacy, the list goes on and on. It is by far the best place I've ever been at, and I doubt it can be topped."
"Stayed for 8 nights from 8 Sep 2022 at Beach Villa 89.  We could not fault the villa with plenty of outside private space including direct access to the beach and our own pool. The outside bathroom and shower was a real treat whilst the use of bikes to get around the island were great fun.  We would recommend the half-board option which allows you access to every restaurant.  Our GEM organised our bookings so we experienced Leaf, Zen and Chill Bar (Longitude was being refurbished during our stay) alongside the two buffets held during the week (Asian Street Food and Mediterranean-based).    Otherwise dinner would be pricey at $120 (plus 22% service charge and tax) per person in each restaurant each night.  Drinks were also expensive, although no different to elsewhere in the‚Ä¶"
"Patrick, Rabba, Adam, and Dilshan were standout hosts!   Rabba was our GEM (Guest Experience Manager), who ensured any of our requests were accomplished to complete satisfaction!

Patrick is the Regional Resort Manager, responsible for most everything on the exclusive island resort.  He greeted us upon arrival to introduce the entire staff. Immediately he made us feel especially welcome. We had an issue arise, without question and with Rabba‚Äôs agreement, they came up with the most extraordinary solution!

"Our experience at Six Senses was out of this world!  It was a next level experience!

"The hotel and staff were amazing. Even though we had some cloudy and rainy days, our stay was perfect. The food, diving and spa were the highlights of our stay. The restaurants, especially Leaf, had amazing food and the breakfast was incredible. My wife and I got our advanced scuba certifications at the dive center and managed to see a few mantas up close so well worth the trip. If you plan on going to the spa, try out the couples massage or the Ayurvedic treatments, they are amazing. Lastly, Aslah (GEM) and Dottie (from the dive center) really helped make our honeymoon trip even better."
"From stepping off the plane in Male we could not fault the amazing service and experience that Six Senses Laamu provided!   We visited for our honeymoon and it was the perfect location for a husband that can't sit still and needs all the activities, and a wife who wanted to relax and soak up all that The Maldives has to offer. We came for the surf and left with a new hobby, scuba diving! Exploring the underwater surrounds of the island was truly magic. The accommodation itself offered the idyllic over water bungalows, the staff were extremely welcoming and went above and beyond to ensure we had the best experience possible. The cherry on top was learning about their sustainability focus, and the commitment to ensuring the resort was run with a respect for the local community and‚Ä¶"

"I recently visited with my two daughters and a few other mom friends with kids. We all had an amazing time. Our GEM (concierge/butler) Sobah was wonderful, ensuring we could book meals together, and activities for the kids. I was able to rediscover my joy of scuba diving. The kids club was an incredible treat for my girls. The kids also get lots of freedom by riding bicycles around the resort. I had low expectations re food & beverage, and was mistaken. Lawrence does a great job with his team. Ritesh the main sommelier from (surprise) India was knowledgeable, personable, and enhanced our visit. This resort is focused on sustainability and environmental consciousness. There‚Äôs lots to learn and experience in an accessible manner. The spa was heavenly. It was truly paradise on‚Ä¶"

The GEM concept is brillant, the Den (kids club) is fantastic, it's not just stay in there and play yourselves, they have loads of different activities everyday, the grow ups can relax without worries."
My lovely wife and I visited Six Senses Laamu for 7 nights in August 2022 which is during their low season and a time when rain can be expected. We only experienced a single nighttime shower and wonderful weather around 28 - 30 degrees centigrade the whole week. The benefit of the low season is that the resort was only around 50% full.  Getting to the resort requires a 40 ‚Äì 50-minute flight from Mal√© to Kadhdhoo Island and a 15 - 20-minute speedboat transfer to the resort. We were met by Six Senses staff on arrival at Mal√© and assisted from arrivals to domestic check-in and to the lounge awaiting our Maldivian flight. On arrival at Kadhdhoo we were again met by Six Senses staff who took our luggage and guided us for the 3-minute walk to the transfer speedboat. We were given shoe‚Ä¶
"At the prices involved (accommodation/meals etc) i was hoping this would be an awesome experience,and wasn‚Äôt disappointed.Being met off the boat by our personal GEM( guest experience maker) got our week underway..Our seven days were absolutely magical.And we overpacked.You need only bathers shorts and t-shirts.Shoes are optional.So it costs a bit but the experiences we had over the week were priceless.Our GEM was extremely supportive"
"I'm a Six Senses Laamu junkie. It's an otherworldly, luxurious, un-fussy retreat into relaxation and restoration. The villas, the restaurants, the spa, the diving, the personal service and attention to detail are all beyond compare. Can't wait to go back!"
"- Amazing water villas (I recommend villa 18) - Outstanding service coordinated by the Guest Experience Manager (GEM) assigned  - Good / balanced offer of activities (Wellness, Water Sports, etc) - Diversity and quality of restaurants in the Island  It‚Äôs my 6 sixsenses experience and definitely the best so far!"
"We had an amazing stay in Laamu back in May this year. The whole experience was simply unforgettable. Genuinely friendly and attentive staff, simply amazing service, nothing was ever too much trouble, we were made to feel incredibly welcome from the moment of our arrival. The scenery is simply stunning, beautiful beaches with clear waters having an abundance of sea life. We were staying in a beach villa which was also stunning, private with a beautiful sea view, truly blissful. The food at a choice of restaurants was also amazing, we travelled with our 13 month old son and the staff were fantastic at helping keep him entertained at mealtime.

Stephany was our GEM and she was an angel - having her perfectly organise our program, to which she added many personal and thoughtful touches, we were never ready to leave. And are SO looking forward to returning. Couldn't recommend more highly."
"For years I had wanted to travel to the Maldives after seeing photos of the most exquisite beaches I had ever seen. When a friend mentioned she was going, I decided to come along as a birthday present to myself.  I could not have imagined what  a wonderful and healing gift this would end up being.  Six Sense Laamu is the perfect balance of  a 5 star, top- notch, incredibly professional resort and a relaxed, easy, casual atmosphere. I was impressed with their commitment to sustainable, care for the environment and sea life and educating their guests.

"We had the most amazing time here. The resort goes above and beyond a five star experience with its attention to detail and personalisation. The food, the activities, the villas, the snorkeling were all fantastic.  When you arrive, you leave your shoes behind and acquire a bike to get around the resort along boardwalks and lovely sandy pathways.  There are ten permanent marine biologists doing research and education on the island and they lead guided snorkeling trips and give talks. The emphasis on the island is, not surprisingly, on the ecology and preservation of ocean life.   There are choices of places to eat and the food is all wonderful. The staff knew our grandson loved the steak special for breakfast and so provided a surprise one for his last day.  The pancakes for the‚Ä¶"

"We arrived at Six Senses Laamu with high expectations for our honeymoon after reading all the fabulous reviews. And having just left yesterday I can wholeheartedly say it is the best place we have ever been to in the world. We were so sad to leave but already excited to plan a return.   Marteyne, Patrick, Laurence and team have created the perfect island family into which each and every member of staff will adopt you into.  From the moment you step foot on the speedboat transfer and are handed a bag for your shoes (because who needs footwear in paradise?) to the final free ice cream before departure, every single hour of every single day of our stay was truly incredible.   Six senses (not just Laamu) upon arrival provide you with a Guest Experience Manager (GEM). Our GEM Thohir‚Ä¶"
"ÔªøIn mid-July we visited the Maldives for the fifth time and had a wonderful holiday at Six Senses Laamu.  It is a beautiful lush green island  and the thatch timber villas and buildings are stunning.  We stayed in a Laamu over-water villa (sunrise, end of jetty A) and we were so happy with our choice. The water is stunning and we would swim and watch the turtles and other sea life throughout the day.  The villas are excellent, much bigger than the photos show and serviced twice a day.  We had our teenage daughter with us and she was very happy with her bed and view and the room was constantly managed for 3 people (ie 3 robes, water and glasses etc without any prompting). The outdoor bath/shower is great, only request would be for a little table in the outside bathroom area to‚Ä¶"
"My wife and I came back again 5 years after our first visit. Very little has changed and with good reason. It is a magic place and our fantastic GEM (Guest Experience Match) Soba with great colleagues, made sure that the service level again reached its Max.   Yes, a couple of rainy days, but it took nothing away from the experience of the place. We were snorkling and saw turtels, sharks, stingrays, thousands of fish and an octupus. Marvellous. The food experience reached another High level with Chef, Jesper Koch, visiting from DK with his fantastic family.  We Hope to make a round 3 to The resort."
"Our stay at the Six Senses Laamu was a sublime experience.  The over water villas were a little heaven on earth.   The food and service were beyond amazing.  Shout out to Stephany who coordinated our daily experiences and the resort manager, Patrick.  The environment and people here both made our stay so lovely."
"We had an amazing time at Six Senses !! Everything and everyone was so nice and friendly ü•∞  a special thanks to Ainura, who always stood ready for us and made sure all our wishes became reality ! The Diving experience was for me the highlight of our stay ! The monitors Made us feel so safe and comfortable!"
"We stayed at the amazing Six Senses Laamu for 8 days, spanning the last week of June through the first week of July. It was absolutely the best 8 days we‚Äôve ever spent on a holiday as a family, and we have the entire staff at Six Senses Laamu to thank for that.   Villas We opted for the Sunset Overwater Villa, which are located down Jetty A with a clear view of the islands across the way with no other villas in front. We decided not to get the Sunset Laamu Villa with pool since the Sip Sip pool area would provide a wonderful pool experience.

"What an amazing place! Service is top of the notch and the facilities stupendous! We had our own attendant Aslah and he was always able and willing to take care of any request to make our stay even more wonderful. Already planning to return next and the following years.  I am a surfer and swimmer, did not bring any board and the surfing guides had my back. My kid and wife took lessons and loved it. We did scuba once and it was fool of beautiful fauna and flora, but the snorkeling could be just enough because there is so so much to see nearby. The food is excellent in all restaurants. I have been a week before to Niyama and they were also good, but in terms of service and food Six Senses is just in another level."
"Six senses property and staff are simply amazing. From the moment you step out of the plane, they pamper you and make sure you relax and  enjoy the vacation! My husband and I are most definitely going back and take our children next time! Our GEM, Stephany, went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. She booked restaurants, excursions and treated us like family."
"Six sense laamu was beautiful and wonderful places. All staffs in leaf, sipsip and chill bar are very kind and nice. Foods are excellent. Special thanks to our GEM Aslah and our dive trainer Izaaz üòÉ Additionally I would like to thanks to Du Shan as well(cocktail guy in sipsip) They made a perfect honeymoon for us."
Pros:  - Snorkeling & trips led by marine biologists are most informative  - The resort appears to be committed to sustainability   Cons: -Mosquitoes & bugs everywhere!  The only resort out of the 4 in Maldives that I have been to during monsoon off season where mosquito are everywhere. Management can‚Äôt seem to do anything about it.  -Cockroaches in the 2 different villas we stayed at - Stormed 9 out of the 15 days we were there which is not their fault but Six Sense definitely did not prepare the guest or villas for it. Only fix issues after the fact instead of making sure the villas could sustain the storms & everyone keeps the windows and doors shut  - Much noise disturbances @ night from things in villa falling apart or banging during the storms - Many little management‚Ä¶
This is an incredible island. The villas are beautiful. The food is out of the world & the staffs were so helpful particularly our Gem Aslah. Was very kind & patient with us. This island is very beautiful with everything you need to have a fabulous holiday. we were sad to leave and it was lovely that staffs came by to say goodbye & waves us off from the jetty.  We only wished we could stayed longer.
"Wow! My wife and I just returned from 7 nights in absolute paradise! Everything from the accomodation, food, service and ambiance was out of this world! We really enjoyed our surfing with the amazing team of Tropicsurf and my wife had 2 of the most amazing dives with the dive team there. We will definitely be back!!"

Sobah took care of us from the first minute with exemplary dedication, every detail being taken care of, and making us feel like we were more than just ‚Äúanother guest‚Äù‚Ä¶ he ensured every day our experience was unique and tailored to us, was proactive in reserving and offering us different options for lunch, activities during the day‚Ä¶ and he went above and beyond in making us feel welcome and taken care of. I hope we can go back soon and hopefully we will be lucky enough to get Sobah again, although we wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to learn that he has been promoted!! For anyone reading this, if you can‚Ä¶"
"What an amazing experience.....From the moment we arrived, we were warmly greeted by the management and staff at Six Senses Laamu and treated like royalty and family simultaneously.  How is that possible, you may ask?  A staff that is so excellent, it almost cannot be put into words.  You can ask any staff member a question about anything (about the resort, Maldives, food, drinks, culture, etc), and they will tell you the answer.  If on the off chance they cannot answer your question, they will immediately find someone who can answer it.  And they really care - about you, your experience, their resort, their country.  Maldivians want you to love their country as much as they do and have an amazing experience when staying there.  Unparalleled in any place I have ever stayed‚Ä¶"
"Just returned from Six Senses Laamu and it was amazing.  First, I would like to thank our GEM, Ashraq, for being a wonderful guide and host for our stay.  Ashraq was welcoming, attentive, extremely friendly, and always available to assist us with questions, bookings, and activities.  He was one of the key reasons why we enjoyed our stay as much as we did.  In fact, all of the resort staff we met were simply wonderful and I can‚Äôt say enough about our experience with them.    With respect to the resort, it was really easy to kick back and relax from day 1.  Their policy is to encourage everyone staying to take off your shoes and enjoy the island life once you get off the speed boat to the island.   Once there, you are subject to gorgeous views of clear turquoise water, pastel‚Ä¶"
"I can hardly put into words how amazing an experience we had at Six Senses. To be greeted by the whole staff upon arrival. Everyone was so kind and courteous and created the most amazing atmosphere. Good and facilities are top level and the whole approach to sustainability was also superb. A perfect week in paradise, amazingly assisted by Shah who took care of our family group all week. Cannot speak more highly of the beautiful women at kids club who were like additional mothers for our children such was the care they showed to our young boys. I just wish more families could share our same experience‚Ä¶ we will definitely be back!"
"The experience was a 10 out of 10. From minute one we felt in paradise. The food, the room, the staff, the atmosphere... it is very hard to choose one over the other.   It was the first time we visited a Six Senses, and Maldives, but certainly will be the first of many at both.  I don't want to leave many details on the stay as I want to avoid spoiling others experience on this ""once in a life time experience""   Special mention would need to be given to our GEM, Thohir, who made us feel at home as if we were true family! My sister is visiting the Six Senses in a few months time and I have already requested that he is their GEM  Also, Elena, at the Dive Center... what a diving session with her, and how supportive she was over our entire stay. Much√≠simas gracias Elena! Hope we‚Ä¶"
"We visited Six Senses Laamu on our honeymoon from 29 July 2022 to 6 August 2022 and stayed in an overwater villa. Originally I had booked two other resorts however, changed my mind at the recommendation of my luxury travel and I‚Äôm glad I did. We had the most incredible stay!!  The main things that made our stay unique was: 1. The service - how staff always put your needs first and did so kindly - nothing was ever too big of an ask e.g I‚Äôm not very good on a bike and they offered to make a Bike for me and my husband that had hand breaks :)  2. The emphasis on sustainability at this resort. I would suggest doing the sustainability tour if you do stay. They are miles ahead of any hotel I have ever stayed in. I am obsessed with their garden especially their mushroom hut and their‚Ä¶"
"Paradise! That‚Äôs the only way to describe this unbelievable island holiday. The long journey we took to travel here was completely worth the effort, and our family will have fond memories for years to come.  The island and property itself are simply stunning. There are no pictures that can do it justice. The ocean water is like nothing we‚Äôve ever seen before, the clearest and most beautiful in the world with rays and tues swimming by as we showered each day.  The food was outstanding and totally exceeded our lofty expectations. Most impressive was the sheer variety of cuisines from around the world‚Ä¶somehow the kitchen staff pulled all that off, with frequent changes throughout our stay to keep the menus interesting with the freshest ingredients.  Special shout-out to our‚Ä¶"
"the resort is perfect, the environment, the workers, the food‚Ä¶ our GEM was Ash and he was attentive to us so that our stay was perfect.  hopefully we can come back soon. Highly recommend the Leaf and Zen restaurant"
"Amazing family holiday in Maldives at this resort. Great hospitality from our GEM Ashraq who went to great effort to ensure everything was perfect for the duration of our stay. Incredible food. Great adventures snorkelling, surfing. Thoroughly enjoyable holiday."
Staying at Six Sense Laamu was an wonderful experience! We got really surprised when we arrived at Six Senses and were welcomed in Portuguese (our idiom) by Stephany. She is one the GEMs (guest entertainment makers) of the hotel. She is so kind and attentive. She made everything she could to guarantee that our staying in Six Senses was perfect and unforgettable. Thank you Stephany! I hope see you again in Six Senses next time. ‚ù§Ô∏è Ps.: The food is delicious.
"There is no detail that doesn't seem perfect to me. Starting with our GEM Tho, the most wonderful person on the planet, a great professional and the best person.  We have gone on a trip with two children aged 5 and 7 years old and it has been an unforgettable experience. We had such a good time that I would repeat it without thinking about it.  The staff is always charming. The rooms are magnificent. Estrella Michelin's meal with an orchard that is perfect. Snorkeling a pass from the same room, turtles, rays, sharks... and every day we saw dolphins crossing the atoll. The kids club and activities for children are fun and very attentive, of those who really take care of your children and you rest because they have a great time. Countless water activities and diving (what nice and‚Ä¶"
"Wonderful stay, although we got some rainy days. Barefoot chic vibe with excellency in service and food. Leaf restaurant was our preferred. Overwater Villa decor in wood and natural fibres. Many thanks to our GEM Stephany that made our days even better."
"We visited Six Sense Laamu for our late honeymoon/vacation. We had such a wonderful experience during our time with them. Nora (our GEM) was lovely, very pleasant, and accommodated to all of our requests. We went on multiple snorkeling trips (private and in group, Muftiha and Jake were amazing!) and saw a variety of wildlife (such a unique experience). The marine biologists on site provided explanations and pointed out multiple things through out our snorkeling trips. The dive center was also amazing, Elena (our dive instructor) was very patient with us as we attempt our first diving experience. We also did some fun activities around the island like making chocolates. The food was simply delicious with so many cuisine choices, and also vegetarian friendly. The variety of fruits‚Ä¶"
"From the moment we were greeted until the last wave goodbye we were pampered and made to feel as if we were royalty.  Stephany our GEM was available at a moment‚Äôs notice to ensure that we could experience everything that we wished. I visited the spa 4 times and my husband went once; the therapists were professional and caring, and the treatment choices were spectacular. I particularly enjoyed the 90 minute body scrub, which left my skin with a youthful glow and gave me a boost of energy. Adrian, a visiting practitioner taught me and my husband helpful stretches and posture practices that we are implementing. Waiters Na√Øf, Naail, Toto, Jacks, Muhey and ALL others we encountered genuinely took pride in their work and always reached beyond the required to enhance our experience on‚Ä¶"
"Amazing resort ! Great staff and the best hospitality. The best place we ever visited. Unmatched in every way. Food, villa, views, sustainability focused but without any compromise.  They accommodate for any food restrictions without compromising taste. It was very clean and everything was well sanitized.  We saw tons of sea life all around the resort."
"We had 2 villas side by side on Jetty B. My husband and myself in one and our 3 adult children in the one next door. We have just returned and can honestly say it was the best family holiday we have ever had. This is not just a honeymoon destination, our family loved every minute of it. We all scuba dived with Elena and Danny from the dive team who looked after us beautifully. We surfed with Archie and the surf team which took us out to the surf breaks and on top of that the snorkelling at the resort in the incredibly warm water was sensational with so many turtles and fish. Thohir was our GEM and he was brilliant as was Nile who seemed to be in every restaurant we went to. Food was outstanding and we definitely made a trek to the 48 flavour complimentary ice cream cafe far too‚Ä¶"
"It has been awesome,  dream location, incredible villas, delicious food, adventure and best of all: service.  The staff knows what and when you eat and drink and they are all there to help, explain about the maldives and the culture..   It has been breathtaking experience.  Thanks to Stephany, Hisham and Nail for taking such a good care of us."
"The customer service from the staff at this resort is flawless! Happy to accommodate your every need where possible to ensure your stay is magic.  From the moment we arrived at Male airport to the moment we left we were cared for. Our 17 hr journey from Australia to the resort took 56hrs due to cancelled flights however upon arrival it was all forgotten as the staff made sure every possible worry was eliminated.  Our GEM Hamza, what a legend! Always checking in to see if there was anything we needed and making our stay special. On his day off we had Ashraq look after us. His big beaming smile was infectious and he ensured my husbands 50th birthday dinner on the beach was seamless.  The staff at Tropicsurf Ange and Archie were amazing from day 1! They ensured my husband was‚Ä¶"
"We stayed for a week with our two children and our expectations were blown out of the water. The sunset overwater villas were like living in a dream, the food, the scenery, the ocean. All INCREDIBLE. What made our stay truly incredible was our GEM Shah. The loveliest person we have ever met, we were so sad to leave him behind. The kid‚Äôs also adored Ali while doing the junior marine biology course. He was so engaging and enthusiastic. We will definitely be back!"
"Our stay at Six Senses was nothing short of spectacular. We‚Äôve been to a handful of 5 star resorts, but Six Senses set a new standard of service and excellence for us, truly. Everything, from arrival and checkin, to quality of complimentary amenities (be sure to book with breakfast included, and take advantage of snorkeling as much as possible), to chef curated menus, and so much more. Some how, all the luxury touches  get packaged together in a down to Earth, and nature-first offering that has made a lasting impact for my wife and I.  We are thankful to so many of the staff members that made our stay special: Buddy, Ali, Muhi, Sean, Pramodh, Nishit, and of course Abdulla and the ice cream lady that we bothered 5 times a day for free ice cream."
"Our brilliant travel company, Turquoise, diverted us to Laamu as Six Senses had just acquired our original pre-covid destination at Kanahura and are in the process of refurbishing the resort.   We have stayed at 2 other Six Senses resorts so knew it would be lovely - and indeed it was.  We were made so welcome and felt at home instantly.  Marteyne, the GM and Patrick, the Resort Manager were charming and Lawrence, the Food and Beverage Manager oversaw an inspiring and always delicious dining experience.  We particularly enjoyed the buffets and also the wonderful service at Leaf. The Spa was beautiful - thank you Benita and Khoda - and very atmospheric. We stayed in a lovely beach villa [87] with lots of outside cover, for which we were extremely grateful as the weather wasn't‚Ä¶"
"Flawless execution from each team (airport pick up team/F&B management/housekeeping/dive and surf centres) made our belated honeymoon experience perfect. Breakfast specials and fresh juices & smoothies change daily. Food quality at each restaurant is also top notch and we felt we were dining at a Michelin-started restaurant every night. Especially desserts at every restaurant were exceptional, particularly Zen‚Äôs matcha tart!! Our GEM (Ath-har) was so accommodative and responsive to all our inquiries. Marine biologists who run snorkelling  sessions are very helpful and knowledgable as well. House reef and sea grass areas are just phenomenal, we got to see eagle rays and a green sea turtle just casually chilling next to our water villa jetty. The most amazing part was the sunset‚Ä¶"
Our stay was absolutely amazing! All the staff was extremely nice and attentive to our every need!  Our Gem Abdulla was amazing! Adjusted our itinerary on the fly as we made changes and we ended up getting everything done that we wanted to do.  The hotel amenities were impeccable and clean.  Everything was perfect!
"It was an amazing experience & thanks to the hospitality from the resort. The resort exceeded our expectations. Many happy memories were made, the resort suited our requirements & was very much different to the normal 5* resorts when it comes to friendly & helpful staffs. The private & exclusively nature of the resort was amazing. Our guest experience maker (Aslah) deserves a special mention. He left no stone unturned & there was no job too big or small for him in order to give us the most memorable experience possible. He is a real Gem & a great asset to the company. We also saw cool bats, lizards, crabs, rays turtles & small baby sharks. We hope to go back soon & recommend the experience for anyone lucky enough to go. we had an amazing time..Thank you againüòä"
We went here for our honeymoon & my wife's birthday. The service from the resort is beyond any expectation. The staffs were phenomenal & made our stay such a pleasure. The food was amazing at every restaurant & the drinks made by the barmans in chill bar were amazing..we were provided with snorkel gear for free as well kayaking plus paddle boarding. You also gets the bikes for each guests to ride around the island which was quite nice. I highly recommend going here if you are planning to visit to Maldives. We stayed in a water villa & i can't explain how beautiful the experience was in words. i hope to be back one day soon as this truly was one of the best holiday we had. It is expensive but every penny is worth it when you see the quality of what you get.  I would like to give‚Ä¶
"It‚Äôs certainly an amazing journey! We stayed 4 nights , each inch of the island is full of the beautiful views, the service is top, people are very friendly and nice, Atahhar‚Äôhelp  is the really good .foods are exquisite! Days are never enough to be here !cant wait to be back soon! Thanks for everything!"
"The welcome from all the staffs was amazing & we were given a personal butler (Gem Aslah) to look after us during our entire stay. Nothing was too much to bother & we had direct number which he responded to almost immediately. The location was fantastic & views were amazing. Since we visited slightly out of the season, a lot of experiences were very much so private & memorable. We ate at all the restaurants & all the foods was fantastic. Lots of choice & plenty of it. All the activities were easily accessible & all the staffs were very friendly & helpful. The cast away experience is a must, so magical & just like the movies!"
"Best hotel on Maldives for sure, magic food excellent stuff beautiful rooms, everything exceptional for sure place to go when you go to Maldives . Everything organized to perfection.

"This place is incredible, could not recommend enough. Staff were all amazing and the rooms are beautiful, everything was perfect and clean. Our GEM Ath-har was beyond helpful and lovely. Not a flaw on the whole island. Will definitely be back!"
"Returned back home after a long holiday. Felt like it was a must to write a review about this beautiful place. Everything was well organized from the time you step into Male' airport. Six senses laamu representative arranged everything for us to make our trip between Male' airport & the resort as smooth as possible. From the moment we arrived to the island, it was like a paradise..We stayed in a sunset laamu water villa which was heaven on earth. We were able to step into the sea from the steps on the side of the vill deck. Our Gem Aslah was very attentive & could not have done more for us. Just ask him & he would immediately get things done. The foods we had in all the restaurants were some of the best foods we had. All the staffs we encountered were very friendly & supportive.‚Ä¶"
My husband and I went to Six Senses as part of our honeymoon and we were blown away by how beautiful the place was. Our villa was stunning and  the common areas (swimming pool/restaurants/bars) were all so well done.  The service was amazing and the food to die for (we particularly loved the themed buffet dinners and the free ice cream!). Special thanks to all the staff who made us feel at home and particularly to our dedicated captain Stephany who was always available for us and made sure we had everything we needed - thank you so much!!
"My wife and I stayed at Six Senses for her birthday and I can hands down say it‚Äôs the best place we have ever stayed. The island was simply stunning, the rooms were incredible and the staff were super friendly and welcoming. To top it off the food and drink was exquisite and I will definitely be visiting again in the future.   I would like to make a special mention to Ashraq. He was always on hand to answer our questions and help in anyway possible through the WhatsApp group and really went above and beyond. He elevated our excitement and provided excellent recommendations what to eat and do during our visit."
The beauty of the place & the island is a thing of imagination. The staffs are all very friendly & helpful. We had a fantastic service from our very attentive butler Aslah. Nothing was too much for him. He went out his way to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. It was wonderful to have many dining options every night. Food was top notch in every restaurant with many choices. The spa was amazing. The therapists were amazing & the treatments were magical. We love cycling everywhere & it felt so very safe & relaxed. All in all a very fantastic stay!
"Just returned back from a long vacation half spent in Maldives. Thank you so much to all the staffs who made this trip so memorable. Thank you to our Butler Aslah for your kindness & efficiency. Thank you to the dive team for making us discover the under water experience for the first team.  Everything was perfect from the villa, water sports, foods 100%, we will return back soon!"
"This place is so unique and offers sooo much. It‚Äôs a true culinary experience, like the food you are served is unreal. We couldn‚Äôt believe the presentation!! There is so much to do here from diving, surfing, or simply snorkeling the amazing house reef, swimming, the fun pool, jet ski, kayak, SUP, or simply walk the beach and look for shells. There are sand sharks right in the shoreline!!! Hermit crabs in abundance. Rays, dolphins are a common sight as you enjoy a meal overlooking the water. You bike everywhere which is so fun. The villa is spacious and the bathroom is so unique and fun. Outdoor rain shower, glass tub that looks down onto the ocean, a huge deck you can jump right into the ocean from. The list goes on and on! We ordered breakfast one morning to our villa and it‚Ä¶"
"Spent one week with my family in this amazing resort. Exceptional in every aspect, the beautiful villas, delicious food & impeccable service.   The highlight for us was the butler service, which made our stay worry less. Our Gem Aslah kindly assisted us in everything during our stay in the resort. From making the bookings & experiences, to clear our doubts about the hotel & giving lots of information about the local islands he was very reliable. He also gave us lots of information about the Mantas & turtle activities happening in the island been very patient with us. I would like to express my gratitude for all the precious memories & highly recommend six senses laamu if someone travels to the Maldives."
"A long awaited trip to this special place did not disappoint.   It's a fair way to go; big plane to Mal√©, then a wait for the 35 minute flight to Laamu‚Äôs Kadhdhoo Airport, then the boat to the resort island itself. But it's worth it.  We stayed in a Sunset Laamu Water Villa which was located on Jetty A, so nice and close to the Main Jetty. You have bikes to get around and we used these all the time. You can cycle around the island in about 15 minutes. The snorkelling is better from other Jetties, but the sunsets were spectacular.  You can read all about how wonderful staying at Six Senses Laamu is from the other reviews on here  and I would agree with many of them.   Our standout highlights were watching the turtles hatching at night and snorkelling with turtles during the day.‚Ä¶"
The most beautiful place I have ever been! A really comfortable beach villa with an amazing bath room. The house reef surpassed expectation. The food was amazing when you consider that most of the things needs to be imported & we enjoyed every meal. There was lots of choices in the main buffet and a couple of other ala carte choices if need a change. The attitude of the resort to sustainability was a joy and the respect of the staffs for their environment was commendable.   A special to mention must be made to our amazing Gem Aslah who was there to help us in every need. A great smile & with much efficiency and who always made us feel particularly welcome. Overall a fantastic stay!
"There is not a single hotel/resort that compares to Six Senses Laamu. Six Senses Laamu was downright amazing.   After 39 hours of travel, we were greeted on the welcome dock by the leaders of each department standing hands folded in front of them, ready to please. Most importantly, we were introduced to our Takaru (butler), Sobah. Sobah singlehandedly made our trip. From our wonderful, personal and touching conversations before and after dinner, to the care he put into organizing every minute of our trip.  We stayed in the Ocean Water Villa. The room was absolutely beautiful - so much outdoor access but with plenty of privacy. The floor of the bathroom has a glass panel so you can watch the fish while you do your business.   TropicSurf - 10/10. Not only were both my boards‚Ä¶"
"The most blissful & heavenly 5 days. This place is a dream, it's visually stunning. The staffs are all incredible. The food was exquisite and the accomodation is idyllic. the restaurants served the best foods. There was literally nothing to fault about the entire experience. Special thanks to our amazing Gem Aslah & the other staffs who helped make our stay perfec. Highly recommended."
We had an absolute great time in six senses laamu. The place is beyond amazing. Great spa with so professional staffs. We stay in a water villa & we felt so great for our choice. Villa was super clean & neat. Amazing restaurants with amazing foods. Staffs were wonderful. Extra ordinary service was from our Aslah (our Gem) & Samah (our villa attendant). We can't wait to come back!
"This was one of the most amazing trips ever.  You are greeted and assisted with luggage and check in from the moment you are at the airport, flown on a domestic flight (about an hour) to Laamu where you are met and taken by speedboat to the island.  You are greeted by the staff and your GEM who assists you with everything.  Right off the boat there is complimentary ice cream all day - every day with tons of flavors to try and an Alvina's chocolates which were wonderful.  While all the staff were amazing, our GEM Ashraq went above and beyond with all our plans from dinners, diving, excursions,  spa and buggies back and forth.  He was truly an amazing person and we were really lucky to have him.  He also arranged for my friend's birthday with the room decorated, chocolate and a‚Ä¶"
"The overarching point is how amazing everything is at Six Senses Laamu.   Firstly, they take care of everything from the moment you book your stay. It‚Äôs super easy to get to the island because as soon as you get to Mal√©, a Six Senses employee physically walks you through everything (coming and going regarding the domestic flights). From there the incredible service continues. Our GEM, Shah, possesses amazing attention to detail and truly made our trip wonderful! He made us aware of a ton of great experiences and seamlessly booked it all for us. On the off chance something was fully booked, he kept a watchful eye over the schedule and quickly alerted us to any opportunities. Continuing on the service theme, we were introduced to the sommelier, Retheesh, and he was incredible! His‚Ä¶"
Celebrated 25th wedding anniversary. We are so pleased with this resort. The whole experience from check in to check out was unbelievable. We want to say a special thank you to our Gem Aslah who made our anniversary unforgettable! Everything was beyond amazing!
We came to Six Senses Laamu to celebrate our babymoon and my husbands birthday and it did not disappoint. Our GEM Abdulla was absolutely incredible helping us to plan and make the most of our trip every step of the way. We did a number of the excursions and special dinners and all were unique and memorable. Thank you so much for a beautiful trip.
"We had high expectations of the resort and we were certainly not disappointed. From the point of reservation, reservations staff Meefaau was super helpful and patient in answering my many queries and assisted to pre-book several of our activities prior to arrival.  From the moment we landed at the international airport to our departure, there was a Six Senses staff available to assist.  Special thanks to our GEMS  Shihan who made all the arrangements throughout our stay and our children had such a wonderful time that they were were so sad to leave.

Special thanks to our excellent Gem Shihan for taking such good care of us and making everything worked effortlessly.  We can‚Äôt wait to come back‚Ä¶."
"My wife and I had a wonderful stay at Six Senses Laamu. Luxury hotel but with a relaxed vibe. For example, nobody wears shoes at the hotel.  Our GEM Stephany was great. She took care of anything we needed. And the Tropicsurf team (Noe, Archie, Uma, Angela, Stephany, Ali, etc) was awesome. Great surfing with all their support. For example, my surfboard had a ding (probably because of the long air travel) and they fixed it before I used the board.  Best trip ever!"
"Went to Laamu Six Senses with my wife for our honey moon and now I know it was the perfect call. The facilities, the landscapes and the human team you will find there, will make this an unforgettable experience, as it has been for us.  Also, our Gem, Hamzath, made our life much easier, being in charge of everything and letting us focus on having as much fun as possible."
"We had a fantastic holiday at Six Senses Lammu with our friends. The staff is extremely nice and fantastic, especially Sobah (our Gem) and Tan, who are always available to assist us or answer any questions or concerns we may have. I adore the natural beauty of this location, and it makes me want to return as if I were at home. During our stay, we can participate in a variety of enjoyable and educational activities such as snorkeling, presentations, body massages, fishing, jet skiing, dolphin cruises, and more. Oh yeah, the food there is pretty delicious, special, and fresh, and they have a variety of foods that we always wish to sample at each meal. I would strongly advise couples & families to visit this location."
This island is the most beautiful and comfortable place that I have ever been to.   The people here is very kind. Our housekeeper Ashraq is very nice and helps us a lot. He give us lots of information about the activities in the island.  The food here is good. And the activities is interesting. Different activities in different seasons. The Zen is a Japanese restaurant tastes good. The sashimi is fresh.
"It is really really an excellent experience in Six Senses laamu.  The service is really good, the staff here is very nice and kind. Our Housekeeper Ashraq is very nice and careful. He helps us a lot.  The food and entertainment in the island is very good. The leaf restaurant. The snorkeling is fantastic."
"We had a lovely stay, hospitality was amazing and our GEM,  Stephany, was excellent! She assisted us in all sorts of areas around the resort. Activities are enjoyable and memorable and equipment are in good condition."
"We had our stay in the beach villa with pool and Laamu water villa with private pool, the accommodations at this five-star resort are impeccable.   Special thanks to our dedicated GEM ASLAH for taking good care of us and attend to our every want and need at anytime. Please look out for him when you are at Six Senses Laamu he is more than happy to assist anyone there. Not to mention Tan our sales manager she is friendly and patient to us and also Warren, bar supervisor who made us wonderful drinks and booze and always keep a big wide smile with him.  All in all, the staffs here are wonderful,  I would recommend this gorgeous place for everyone who wants to spend their honeymoon/holidays in heaven."

"This was my third wonderful trip to Six Senses. The accommodations are stunning and very private. The staff, headed by the resort's super GM, all provide incredible service and attention to every detail. The food has always been outstanding and is now even better with a new head chef. Focus on sustainability above and below the water is key at Six Senses. The diving is fantastic and they are building a new marine center that will enhance guests' appreciation for the incredible variety of undersea life in Laamu Atoll and what is being done to sustain and protect it into the future. Five Stars plus!"
"My wife and I took our honeymoon at six senses laamu and spent the best 12 days of our lives there.  The resort is absolutely beautiful, hovering above the crystal clear blue water at all times.  The Villa we stayed in was absolutely perfect.  It was spacious, comfortable, had amazing air conditioning and Wifi.  The back area outside is the most magnificent part.  There's tons of seating and lounging both in the sun and in the shade.  We basically had our own private section of the Indian ocean and swam and snorkeled every day.    Our GEM, Ashraq made our experience even better.  He was extremely accommodating and helpful,  getting us everything we could even think to ask for and more.  He makes sure you are having the absolute best time, at every second of the day.  By the end‚Ä¶"
"My husband and I traveled to Six Senses Laamu from New York for our honeymoon and it was the best decision we made! The resort is stunning, the food is delicious, the nature is beautiful and the people we met and worked with went above and beyond to make sure our stay was nothing less than perfect. It was the perfect vacation. Thank you to everyone at Six Senses for making our honeymoon dreams come true!"
"We stayed in the water villa and we were in love with the house reef , my son cried when we left , bidding goodbye to the rays, turtles, octopus, dolphins and fishes. Thank you Nino, our GEM for always taking extra steps and making our stay even more memorable. We will definitely be back."
"We had a wonderful stay in six senses laamu , everything was perfect . This resort has definitely topped our expectation and it is one of the best ever visited resort.   Our GEM, Mr. Sobah, is great and very welcoming. He will be there for all of our needs. He is a really efficient, polite, and helpful person. It's been great getting to know Sobah on this journey. Thank you very much for your wonderful hospitality. Appreciated!   I'd also like to thank one of their employees, Ms. Tan, for being quite helpful and supplying us a lot of information about the island.  We will definitely suggest this location to others, as well as rebook and return very soon! I look forward to seeing you all again!"
"Six Sense Lamuu delivers 5 star service throughout your whole stay. From landing at the airport in Male Maldives you have someone waiting for you from Six Senses to help you check in for the domestic flight to the island , then after the 35 minutes air plane ride we take a 20 minute boat ride to the magical island. My wonderful host Stephanie was amazing throughout the whole stay. Anything we needed she was there for us. Once you arrive you‚Äôre greeted by everyone who‚Äôs working on the 5 star resort. Which was amazing. How everyone remembers your name makes it even more personal and a loving experience. I will definitely come back will look into coming back my next birthday , I recommend this island/resort to anyone looking for an amazing experience. Can‚Äôt forget the food that was‚Ä¶"
"We are grateful for this journey spent at Six Senses, the lifestyle they promote and the incredible staff made this stay a dream, activities, food was delicious, every moment have been special to us! Marine life is wonderful!  Thanks to our GEM Aslah and all the staff again! We will be back!"
"What an incredible place! Friendly and knowledgeable staff, an insane variety of food (and all top quality), lots of options for activities, beautiful villas and the views‚Ä¶WOW! We couldn‚Äôt recommend this place enough. We spent 5 days here for our honeymoon in June 2022 - perfect weather and the best experience we could have imagined. Some of our highlights: Maldivian cooking class with Issey, sustainability tour with Ali, an incredible beach BBQ dinner and snorkelling at every opportunity. You do not want to miss seeing the marine life here and snorkelling in the sea grass meadows, the house reef and taking a boat trip out and exploring the underwater world in the Atoll.  The incredible reputation of this place is absolutely true - you will not be disappointed. We can‚Äôt wait to‚Ä¶"
"The perfect place to celebrate a honeymoon! We were absolutely blown away at every turn - from the food, customer service, amenities, activities, location, etc. Everything exceeded our already very high expectations based on existing reviews. Our guest experience maker, Aslah, our incredible care into creating an amazing week for us based on our interests. We highly recommend the taking a cooking class if that‚Äôs your thing (Maldivian course with Issey, who was fantastic!). We also loved all of the guided  snorkeling trips where we saw many sea turtles, rays, and other sea life. In short- every available experience we participated in exceeded all of our expectations. We couldn‚Äôt recommend Six Senses Laamu more and can‚Äôt wait to return."
"My wife and I spent our honeymoon in two locations, Dubai for a week, and then hopped over to Six Senses Laamu for 4 days. The Six Senses was the perfect relaxation portion of an unforgettable trip, made even more perfect by the above and beyond service, jaw dropping scenery, and personalized service from our GEM Sharoona!!  Thanks again to the whole Six Senses Village!"
"We can only say that it is the best hotel in Maldives and surely one of the best in the world.  Since you arrive at lamuu they make you feel special, they assign you a person called GEM to accompany you and help you in any possible way , in our case he was Soba, we can only say that his level of attention was outstanding, always willing to help us with the best of smiles and we can say that he is a great ambassador of the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the six senses.  The hotel is charming with great care for the eco and the sustainability of the environment.  They have orchards and restaurants with local food, theme nights and a lot of well-organized activities that have made us spend the best possible honeymoon.  Thank you SixSenses!  see you soon"
"Six Senses Laamu was completely perfect for our 12 night stay. The team have thought of everything - it is the most relaxed and incredible place. Our GEM, Sobah, was incredibly attentive, he helped us maximise every second, and was great fun to get to know! The wildlife is incredible and just omnipresent. The food was exquisite, varied and plentiful, and the wine selection and experiences top notch. The sommelier was incredibly knowledgable and gave really special memorable experiences - highly recommend the cheese and wine tasting and the Champagne dinner. The surfing was totally unique - great coaching and incredible locations like a wave in the middle of the ocean on a reef - uncrowded and beautiful to surf with turtles and dolphins!"
"Incredible place. Made even more special by our wonderful Gem Stephany.  Best combination we‚Äôve experienced of relaxation, food, setting, surfing and lots more. The house reef was also amazing for snorkeling before lunch at the main bar/restaurant."
"I just stayed 13 amazing nights in this blissful paradise. I cannot fault a single thing. If you like very, very good food with wines (thanks Rettiesh!) to match, amazing snorkeling with very knowledgable guides (thanks Greg and all team members of MUI for the great experiences and all the interesting knowledge you shared!!!) an out of this world spa then this is your place. Food was truly impeccable at every venue, so tasty and with so many healthy and vegan options as well. The Mediterranean and Asian buffet nights are just unbelievable in terms of food variety and quality, unparalleled! Leaf deserves a Michelin star. I also loved the laid back style of Chill Bar with very good food, lazing the sunset and night away with the very good sounds of DJ Scott Watson.    I followed a‚Ä¶"
"Heaven! We‚Äôre lucky enough to have stayed in some wonderful places around the world but have to say that Six Senses Laamu is by a long way the best hotel we‚Äôve ever stayed at.  Six Senses is somewhere that gets every little detail spot on, even before you get there. The pre-check in form is a nice touch to personalise the room details for you when you arrive. As soon as we landed in Male we were met by someone from Six Senses and escorted through to the domestic terminal, collected again when it was time to board and it was the same seamless experience when we got to Kadhdhoo through to the speedboat to the hotel. The check-in experience didn‚Äôt feel like a check-in at all - straight to the room and all the details and paperwork sorted in the background whilst you‚Äôre given a tour‚Ä¶"
"My husband and I spent there 4 nights for our honeymoon, and we definitely couldn‚Äôt have chosen better destination. The main team were there for welcoming us, what we found very remarkable. Everything was carefully done, taking care on all the details, landscapes were breathtaking, and food was excellent (pd. the girl at the pankcake‚Äôs is an artist)!  Stephany was our guide there and she did everything for us and was so attentive all the time.  We enjoyed doing the snorkelling, and Angela, the marine biologist, was so nice everytime with us and explained us lots of things!   Staff always with a smile, attentive and nice, 10/10!  We also did hatha yoga, massage at the spa, and sunset cruise‚Ä¶ lots of things to do there!  We will come back, for sure! Thank you so much for this‚Ä¶"
"Just go! You will not regret a moment. We booked a Laamu Water Villa, Sunrise view- this was nice because you could hang out and relax in the afternoons after the sun went behind the bungalow. Although you would have shade most of the morning with the Sunset view- and get to watch an amazing sunset from your villa. We just rode our bikes to the end of the pier to watch the sunset. We would usually be doing activities in the morning. It was amazing being able to swim off of your bungalow to some of the most beautiful coral reefs I've ever seen. Saw sting rays, black tip reef sharks, soooo many fish & corals I've never seen before! The food is over the top amazing. We booked half board and only had to eat two meals a day. I gained weight for sure one his trip- it was a happy & sad‚Ä¶"
"Look, if you really want to know what it's like for the Royal Family when they go on holiday, go to Six Senses Laamu. You get a GEM (Guest Experience Manager) on check in, ours was Sobah (complete legend by the way), and they basically do all the little niggly things like organise your entire flipping holiday. All you need to do is go places and enjoy. I thought the food here was absolutely incredible, every single dish I had was mind blowing. So other than the food and service, the villas are MENTAL. We stayed in an ocean villa on the seagrass meadow and they have everything you could want: comfy 4 poster bed with mosquito net, toilet with floor window into the sea(!), air con, tv, clear bath on glass so you can see into the sea(!!). I could go on but you get the idea. The‚Ä¶"
"After spending 6 nights in sixsenses laamu, the feeling i have is a complete and perfect reconnection with the sea, nature, body and soul. After many years as a dive instructor in beautiful places such as coco island in costa rica, this hotel on top of an AMAZING reef, with little sharks, turtles, rays and dolphins swimming around everyday is just breathtaking. Perfect flow with staff, food, quality activities and other guests. This is a top luxury hotel with a relaxed and real eclectic athmosphere. I feel blessed. Thankyou all staff for the amazing stay, you have all been a top score. Warren and ashla are just two of the names, but seriously, i have never experienced such an epic holiday. Thanks for the tunes Scott!  Cant wait to come back!"
"Everything about our stay at Six Senses Laamu exceeded expectations in a big way.  I went for a dive trip with friends (one friend got certified while there and had a great experience).  The dives were lovely with lots to see and experienced guides.  The staff were very friendly and took great care of us (and our dive gear, including expensive camera equipment).  We had wonderful massages from all of the therapists we tried, and the food was excellent at every restaurant.  If you are looking for a top-notch quiet getaway with excellent service I highly recommend this place.  I‚Äôve never been so relaxed in my life.  I‚Äôll be back for sure!  "
"It was an awesome vacation in every way.  Upon arrival, we were met by our GEM Ash.   He gave us a brief tour of the resort and a suggested weekly schedule for the restaurants and activities, before we checked into our overwater villa.  The room was perfect, and the restaurants all excellent.  Also everyone at Tropic Surf couldn't have been more friendly and helpful.  Together, along with the assistance we received from Ash, it was a vacation we will always remember.  Can't wait to get back again."
"It was really a happy, relax and memorable holiday when we stayed in Six Sense Laamu. This is the best  and the most beautiful hotel we lived ever before, especially the detailed service and all schedule provided for us. Our GEMs Atthar organized everything so well for us so that we can fully relax when stay here. We tried all the activities we never done before, like surfing etc. Even my girl cried on the boat when we left Laamu island‚Ä¶.. We love this paradise place very much and will definitely come back again! Highly recommended!"
"Perfect place and vibe! We love Shah, he was very attentive at all times. He helped us at every stage of our vacation! Perfect and very polite! And the hotel is wonderful! We stayed at water bangal√≤. Lovely place to stay!! Thanks for all the staff that make our vacation unforgettable!!! And thank you, Shah!!!!"
"I cannot fault my experience.   The resort is beautiful. We were greeted by our GEM Shah, who just made our whole experience faultless. He is exceptional and need to be given a promotion !   We stayed in an Ocean Beach Villa with Pool, the villa was comfortable and very well presented. It was private and the surroundings were totally relaxing. You could just walk straight out on to crystal clear ocean.   When we arrived we were told all the activities were complimentary, we went on the dolphin cruise and it was beautiful, we also went on the island picnic and the snorkelling. The sea was full of life and the resort is truly passionate about protecting this which makes six senses different. MUI also did talks on the sea life which I loved. We encountered juvenile black tip sharks‚Ä¶"
"Amazing holiday resort in paradise! This resort is beautiful and the food, accommodation, facilities were great. There is something for everyone to do or you can just totally chill out. It's ideal for couples as well as families. All the staff are very friendly and very helpful. Our GEM (Guest Experience Maker) Abdulla was excellent and very efficient in looking after us. We cannot fault this place at all and will recommend it to all our family and friends. We will definitely go again!"
"My partner and I enjoyed our stay at Six Senses Laamu very much. From the attentive service of our GEM Shihan, to the gourmet food every morning and night. Definitely made our honeymoon experience memorable. Would definitely come back."
"Our stay at the resort was magical right from the time we were received by the resort‚Äôs representative at the MALE airport to our send-off 7 days later.  On the speed boat ride to the island, we were encouraged to pack our footwear and get connected to mother nature. Our bare feet experience on the island is something we reminisce about each day for our entire stay.  Cycling around the island with our personalized cycles is another experience, which stands out. The rides from the villa to the multiple restaurants and around the island have captured our hearts and are our go-to video footage.  We stayed in one of the overwater villas, with a very romantic shower area with a bathtub that has an overwater view. Loved stepping off our deck directly into the ocean.   Six Senses isn‚Äôt‚Ä¶"
"Our stay in Six Senses Laamu will forever stay in our hearts. Me and my mom we‚Äôre welcomed in the arrivals by the very kind department heads. The overwater villa was simply exquisite, we had personalized bikes, beautiful amenities, a  beatiful pool, a very romantic shower area with a bath tub that has an overwater view and a sunset view in the villa! We even got a special dessert with a dedication from Chef Asrie. The main beach and pool in Sip Sip is a lovely spot as well. We loved our spa treatment, cinema under the stars, the sunset dolphin cruise and the handcrafted chocolate tasting/presentation, dining options are great but I must say breakfast in Longitude was our favorite. All the staff were very friendly and service was excellent, we are very grateful to Ms. Marteyne,‚Ä¶"
"My wife and I have been to six senses for our anniversary and her birthday last week. It‚Äôs an very impressive journey. Beautiful scenery and best spar I ever had. The most important is all the staff on the island are very nice , kind and professional, especially our GEM Sobah."
"Six Senses, Laamu is unreal! It is a magical place. The staff accommodates your every wish, and almost anything you want is possible. The setting is gorgeous, and the service is unmatched. Shah was our GEM, and he crafted the perfect experience for us. We would recommend Six Senses to anyone!"
"Very good experience! Friendly staffs and nice food and best spa in the world! Highly recommend my butler Sobah. Amazing ice cream all for free and many turtles around the island. I saw 8 turtles in Snorkeling! He is the best G.E.M I have never meet before! Six Sense promote a lifestyle - caring nature, blending with nature, feeling nature. "
"An absolutely amazing holiday! This place is phenomenal. Beauty at its finest at any hour of the day. It is a blissful paradise. The resort and their staff are kind, warming and friendly. Our  GEM went above and beyond in hospitality. Abdullah was open, friendly, approachable  and made our stay at six senses feel like we were at home but in 7* luxury. Small touches and requests made during the stay were an additional special touch , particularly as we were on our honeymoon.   The food is out of the world. We requested some special dishes as we were missing Indian cuisine. Their talented chefs satisfied that craving, with a variety of dishes at a lunch for us. The restaurants offered a la carte dishes, as well as the main restaurant having tasty dishes based on a themed cuisine‚Ä¶"
"An island paradise: barefoot with style. A location with perfect sea views and magnificent water colors, an exciting house reef and an equally relaxing and refreshing atmosphere. Very nice and super maintained villas, excellent staff (hosts) and delicious food (4 outlets). Very much enjoyed see, beach, pools and spa. The major differentiator, however, are the Six Senses hosts - friendliness and service orientation with a smile. A fantastic experience."
"The villa was just the most amazing accomodation I have ever seen. The comfort factor to enjoy all the gorgeous views. The villa design was just incredible, so much to love and enjoy. From the outdoor shower and bath to your own launch stairs for snorkelling.  We were so impressed with the islands sustainabilty actions from the tour provided it was overwhelming to see the work going on behind the scenes to make this island what it is. Providing work for neighbouring islands as well as how much was being resourced from the island itself was amazing. The snorkelling was next level from the turtles ,rays and reef sharks and the most beautiful fish life beneath the villa to the beautiful reef surrounding. For me the bikes for transport was so special taking me back to childhood and‚Ä¶"
"Our overwater villa was perfect. The layout, the eye for detail, the cleanliness, the privacy were well above expectation. The inclusion of the outdoor shower and separate glass bathtub had to be seen to be believed. The food at the resort was next level. From the Leaf restaurant to the Chill bar to the Longitude breakfast and buffet, it was the best we have had at any resort in the world. Our personal favourite was the Zen restaurant. We have travelled to Japan many times, but the dinners prepared at the Zen restaurant were out of this world. The memory that will stand out for us for years to come will be the incredible staff. Our guest experience maker, Shah went over and above at every point. No request was to difficult, and all requests were delivered with a smile. A special‚Ä¶"
"Exceptionally good in all areas. The resort is attractive with beautiful views over the ocean. Villas are well appointed and comfortable. High standard of catering in five restaurants with great variety from haut cuisine to club sandwiches, local dishes to international specialities. The diving is world class and the experience is hugely enhanced by a highly professional yet easygoing team. The reefs are generally in excellent condition, teeming with life including turtles, sharks and mantas. The resort staff are without exception welcoming and helpful. I must mention in this regard the GEM (general experience manager) assigned to me , Ninni, who dealt cheerfully and competently with all transport arrangements and COVID related matters including Traveller Declaration Forms, in‚Ä¶"
"Of all the islands we have been to in the Maldives ‚Ä¶. And all the islands and resorts have similar things to offer you like the sun, the great golden beach, the perfect pool villa to relax, the spa, the nice restaurants etc ‚Ä¶. But we never came across to a team so dedicated to please you like a one in six senses laamu.  From the moment we step our feet on the island the ambient atmosphere, the kindness and hospitality of the people was unique. It was a unique experience for us. Our Gem Aslah along with the restaurant chefs and the waiters , the wonderful Spa team and of course the house keeping were wonderful. They made our stay extraordinary!!! Thank you Six Senses laamu!!! We will see again soon."
"We came to the honeymoon. The people here are very kind. The food is also very delicious. There are many fish, and there are many turtles. The quality of the food is amazing. ‚ÄúAslah is very kind and always smile,  Niyaz very nice to us and funny. shuihan is very cut and nice.‚Äù I will miss you guys !  after 10 years I'll be back with my baby.

Thank you for always treating us like friends whenever you meet us. Also, my butler ""Shihan"" and ""Aslah"" Very kind and funny üòÅ. Thank you for guiding us well for a long time and leading us to an interesting honeymoon. Dolphin Cruise with SHIHAN was so much fun. I've heard bad news about him, and I hope you can cheer up soon. I would like to thank ASLAH for leading us instead of SHIHAN. I was happy thanks to everyone in LAMMU."
"The journey for us from the UK with two young children was long but it was worth it. From the moment arrived and got onto the speedboat to take us to the resort we were greeted with a smile and warmth from everyone. Our GEM Shihan took care of us from the moment we arrived and made us feel so welcome. We stayed for two weeks in a pool beach villa no.97 and it was amazing, so spacious, very private and had breathtaking views of the ocean, the kids loved our pool and the beach area so much. We had some stormy/rainy days during our stay but it did not take away the beauty of the place.  Laurence, head of F&B always took time to talk to us and get to know our likes and dislikes, he was so friendly, attentive and goes above and beyond, nothing was too much trouble.

"I spent 1 week at Six Senses with my husband and it was a flawless experience since our arrival. The place is incredibly amazing. The concept of wellness luxury is perfectly applied: nothing is over, you are welcome to walk around with no shoes, ride your bike, participate in the activities that you want,  no pressure. Yoga classes, gym, meditation, lectures from biologists and ice cream are some Of the available activities. Food is something apart, healthy, delicious and with so many options that it‚Äôs almost impossible to make a choice without thinking in the other ones‚Ä¶breakfast always with the stunning indian ocean view.

"We spent part ofoiur honeymoon at Six Senses Laamu and it exceeded our expectations, which were very high, by far. Food, staff, drinks and every single view was amazing. Our GEM (Guest Experience Maker), Aslah, was amazing. He offered us a whatsapp number so that we could communicate with him directly during oyr stay. Aslah was amazing and really went the extra mile to make our stay here unforgetable. Would recommend 11/10"
"We had a most incredible relaxing and unforgettable  holidays in the Maldive. Since our arrival we could feel an amazing energy around. Everything it‚Äôs curated in the details. The food it‚Äôs amazing everyone it‚Äôs so kind with the biggest smile! A very pleasent stay! The fact that the hotel take care of the environment, the sea and his flora and fauna, makes u love even more all the experience! A special thank you to Shah, our GEM during our stay.

"Well, nearly three years after booking it, we finally got on our Six Senses Laamu holiday. And it was truly amazing‚Ä¶..  From start to finish we couldn‚Äôt have asked for more or felt so looked after/spoilt (first class Emirates is unreal - still slightly crazy to think we showered in a bathroom, that‚Äôs bigger than ours at home, on a plane!!).   And then Six Senses Laamu itself. Just such a beautiful, awe-inspiring place to spend time with someone you love and forget the rest of the world for a while‚Ä¶‚Ä¶  We had days of activities - snorkelling, swimming, fishing, surfing, jet-skis, dolphin-spotting, biking, running, gym, yoga - and days where we just looked after our bodies and minds.  The spa treatments we had are probably the best we‚Äôve had anywhere and having a personal‚Ä¶"
"The resort was outstanding due to the great team, the location and the design of the spaces. We really appreciate the personal service provided especially by our GEM Shihan. Bearing in mind the remoteness of the island the self sufficiency of the herbs and fish provided some very good results. The weather was mixed. The rain was refreshing then when the sun shone the snorkelling was fantastic. Altitude wine pairing dinner was a hidden secret. We would strongly recommend the experience."
"I feel I can only rate 5 stars of course things are never perfect, but I have rarely stayed in a place that exceeds expectations. The ocean life we saw is really an experience I will never forget. The food was fantastic and the service was exceptional. When it comes to service I cannot forget Ash (Ashraq) who really made the whole experience all the better. In general the staff were second  none. Word must all go to the sustainability side which we really loved. The marine biologists gave some amazing talks and provided some house snorkeling tours of the reef and sea grass meadow. I never generally want to go back to the same place twice this may just be an exception."
"Best Vacation ever!  We have had the most relaxing beautiful time spent in the ocean, Spa, pool, all the amazing first class restaurants on the island! The most  unbelievable food experience we‚Äôve ever had. The staff is above and beyond! Most helpful Staff At every turn literally! Our GEM  Shah, well,  He was the best part of our trip! Took care of absolutely every detail and accommodation for ever dinner planned event and even gave us numerous suggestions for activities, He even escorted us to a neighboring Island to see and walk around with the locals who where so welcoming to us.

He also made sure my husband and friend had food available on the boat for before and after a hard‚Ä¶"
"We stayed at six senses Laamu for 8 nights and got just what we were looking for ‚Ä¶.. total chill. The staff are trained to a high standard and this was obvious as soon as we arrived. We were assigned a great GEM, Ashraq ( Ash) who was there for our every whim and need, not that we needed much, and was a big ray of sunshine on the bad weather days .  There is a great range of activities if you choose to do them, we spent most of our time snorkelling around the reef and sea grass meadows and managed to see a myriad of sea dwellers including sting rays, white tip sharks, dolphins, turtles and lots of colourful fish..   The restaurants at Laamu covered many different styles and tastes which we enjoyed, the food and service was of a high standard and the staff were very engaging and‚Ä¶"
"Thank you Six Senses Laamu for a truly wonderful experience! We stayed for 9 nights and loved every minute of it. Staff are great, attentive and very friendly, food is good and the island is picture perfect. As fate would have it, we could only book the Sunset Water Villa for half of our stay and swapped to a Beach Villa with pool halfway through. Both were amazing and totally different experiences. Would recommend both options! Our GEM Ashraq was really great and took such good care of us the entire stay. The gym is great and better equipped than most other hotel gyms. The spa is amazing, probably one on the best massages I have had! All in all we loved our stay."
"This place is simply amazing and has exceeded our expectations! From the moment we were picked up at the airport and greeted by our wonderful GEM Shah, to the day we departed. The staff here is the BEST! We felt welcomed and part of a family the entire 10 days of our trip. My husband and I joined friends here to surf, relax and take in the Maldivian culture. We enjoyed snorkeling with the Marian Biologist, Miriam and saw several turtles, beautiful fish and Black tip reef sharks. The main reason we chose this hotel was to surf the increadible surf breaks with tropic surf! Our surf guide, Saif from Tropic Surf, is a local surfer who showed us all the breaks and best surfing spots on our trip. The food is 5 stars and the menus changed every night which was unbelievable.

"What an outstanding experience! A gorgeous property with unbelievable  attention to detail, fantastic food and variety and endless activities to indulge in.   Most special however, were the staff. Each and every individual was hospitable, warm, attentive and courteous. Our GEM (Guesy Experience Manager), Afrah, was absolutely incredible - he went out of his way to make sure our honeymoon was better than we could have imagine. Chefs Pramod and Shatapti kept us beyond well fed, and Mohe made sure we were well looked after at any of the restaurant tables. These are only a few names among the many wonderful staff we met.  We have travelled a fair bit and stayed at some quite nice hotels in the past - six senses laamu really does beat them all!"
"We decided to spend our honeymoon at six senses Laamu. From the first second of arrival until the moment we left, we really felt like we lived in a little paradise. Every detail of the stay and our overall experience was truly impeccable. We stayed in a beautifully decorated water villa and usually started the day with watching sunrise, then followed by a yoga or exercise (the most spectacular view), and nice bike ride around the island. This was then followed with extremely good breakfast, lots of organised activities and delicious dinners in the restaurants in the evening. We want to say special thanks to our GEM Ashraq, who was extremely nice, kind, and who really ensured that every minute of our stay in six senses was magical and couldn‚Äôt have been any better.

"This island is just incredible, we will never ever forget our time here, from the word go, everything was so perfect, speed boat transfers were efficient and punctual. The food is so fresh and delicious. The staff are all so friendly and gracious, very hard working. The resort was very safe and easy to navigate. There was so much more here than we thought; we did two excursions, Dolphin Safari & finding Nemo snorkeling & both were fantastic. Dolphin Safari was a huge success, we saw over a dozen dolphins swimming and playing in the water, so magical. The house reef is beyond what we could ever have imagined with so many fish, rays, and sharks and even saw a turtle whilst snorkeling!  I‚Äôve never dived before but went in and booked my first dive for the next day, I had a really‚Ä¶"
"What a truly magnificent vacation! We enjoyed amazing daily scuba diving where we saw mantas, green and hawksbill turtles, large schools of fish and the healthiest hard coral reefs and pinnacles we‚Äôve seen anywhere. We also needed the rest and relaxation with our extremely comfortable and luxurious Villa along with our regular visits to the spa.   The restaurants never disappoint! Our favorite is Zen where the chef serves Omakase using sustainable local fishing for the ingredients on the menu. This resort is number one in our hearts. We had a truly amazing time and can‚Äôt wait to come back next year or even sooner!"
"Me and my husband enjoyed our stay in this hotel. It was the best choice for our honeymoon! Service, our GEM Ashraq, territory of the hotel, all facilities were just perfect. Our villa was wonderful. I couldn‚Äôt find even one minus during our stay. It‚Äôs a real heaven!"
"We were there for 4 days 3 nights and it was actually too short for this awesome place! Me and my boyfriend were actually impressed at the very first time they greeted us. The employees were lovely and our Gem Aslah  (need to mention because he was really nice to us) that we met. He took us to a fun snorkeling trip around the resort. If you're looking for a very nature and simply beautiful place THIS IS THE ONE and it's clean, cozy, comfortable"

That‚Äôs amazing! Thank you everybody, and especially to our professional assistant Ainura. She is more than a GEM!"
"We came Maldives, where has been always the dreaming place in my life, for our honeymoon. But When we arrived to the Male airport we were very exhausted due to delay of local airplane. (came to Maldive Right after wedding ceremony).   But our GEM, Shihan, made us really happy for the whole period in Six senses Laamu. He made all the reservations with kind explanation. He accepted all our favors which made us extremely happy.  If you visit Sixsenses Laamu, hope you meet Shihan!  And all the food and facilities were perfect."
"Amazing experience‚Ä¶pulling all your six senses. Attention to detail, staff, food, atmosphere, service beyond exceptional. You can feel a laid back eco chic resort‚Ä¶brilliant! Our GEM was Shihan, always caring for us, checking on what was needed, anticipating any detail or need we would have. From the moment we have exchanged an initial email with the Six Senses team the journey starts. Traveled the world and been in a lot of places but Six Senses is one of a kind‚Ä¶the concept of the guest experience from arrival till u set foot on the plane back‚Ä¶all there, nothing left unattended. Besides Shihan, our friend who served us dinner on the beach, our Sommelier from Kerala, the staff at the bar, at the restaurants‚Ä¶super genuine, kind and making guests feeling super special. Love it‚Ä¶will‚Ä¶"
Fantastic days and Wonderfull hotel. I was surprise with the quality of its employees. I would like to thanks for Ninni. She follow us every day givining support. She is fantastic  professional and help us a lot. I would like ti have a profissional in mu company like her. She knows everything about how leave your client happy. I will come back as soon as possible
"I have just returned from spending 12 nights at Six Senses Laamu & it is hard to find the words to articulate how truly special this place is. Every member of staff is ready to assist you in any way possible with a smile beaming from their face- the service is simply exceptional. We stayed on Jetty B and were overjoyed with our ocean villa. The views are stunning and for someone who loves the sea as much as myself, I instantly felt in paradise. We ate at all of the restaurants and the food is wonderful. Zen was our favourite although we loved every meal we had during our stay. I must also give a special mention to all of the MUI team. I did many activities with Greg, Miriam, Ally, Alfaz & they were all incredible.  The complimentary house reef and sea grass snorkels are‚Ä¶"
"Arrived at Six senses on Laamu to a very warm welcome from management and team.  We were introduced to the wonderful Shah who would assist and take away any concerns regarding reservations, trips etc.  Shah did this in a very unobtrusive manner and always with a huge smile.  The island was impressive not only for the fantastic over water sites, restaurantsetc but also the well equiped and incredible water villas but also for their sustainability and environmental ethos.  Great team who would answer any questions on the waterlife etc.  Apologies not remembering everyone's name's, they were all fantastic.    Do try the incredible choice of homemade ice cream, 46 served by the ever smiling Aabi.  Superb food and presented perfectly a real feast for the eye as well as taste.  All in‚Ä¶"
"When leaving rhe terminal at Kadhdhoo airport we were met by the Six senses staff, a wondeorful greeting where our bags were taken away and our holiday began.  We boarded a small boat, our shoes were placed in little draw string bags (no shoes encouraged, bare fee,  sheer bliss, ladies, no need for those fancy shoes!!!)  Arriving on Laamu Island did not dissapoint.  The most friendliest of welcomes.  Many management and team members greated it's new guests.   Your introduced to your personal GEM (Great Experience Maker) how lucky were we to have the most wonderful, smiling and effervescent Shah.  Absolutely nothing was to much trouble.  Any questions, requests, changes to meal reservations just a call to Shah and all was settled without any worries from yourself!! Shah would pop‚Ä¶"
"Great food, great room, great amenities. Amazing surf and snorkeling. Luxury in its true sense for a very laid-back experience in total harmony with its environement. But above all, our GEM, Shihan made our stay unique by answering all our needs and even anticipating them in the smartest and kindest way. The kindness of the staff and willingness to make you happy is simply unique."
"This is a very special place with very nice people all around. Our ‚ÄúGem‚Äù Shihan, specifically made everything about our trip even more special. I loved also that there was no plastic anywhere and that it was a very high scale place without being tacky. We will come back."
"Utterly faultless. The best holiday we have ever had. Everything was perfect and I wouldn't change a thing. The only problem is that it's ruined all other holidays.   What I liked - the villas over the water, just wow. The housekeeping the best I've ever experienced, the food in all the restaurants so fresh, healthy and tasty. The snorkelling guided tours every day, our GEM Afra who couldn't do enough, the kid's club and junior marine biology course (JUST AMAZING!!!), the personalised bikes when you arrive, the dolphin sunset cruises, the white sandy beaches, the star gazing at night, how sustainable the resort is, the marine biologists, the pool, the ice cream bar, all of the staff we met.  What I didn't like - nothing. I am spoiled forever as it was completely and utterly‚Ä¶"
"This was our first time visiting Maldives, so our expectations were very high. Six Senses didn‚Äôt disappoint and turned our honeymoon better than expected.   ROOM  The overwater villas are amazing and so is the service, including housekeeping and in villa dining - the room was always impeccably clean and everything in the room works perfectly. The outdoor shower is a must and if you have the opportunity, go for the rooms featuring a private pool - you will hardly leave the room..   We stayed in the end of Jetty C and even though more distant from the hotel main facilities, it feels very private with great views! We spotted many fishes, sharks, octopuses and other sea creatures directly from our villa.    There is only one thing that could be better: the TV. I know that only a few‚Ä¶"
"Very nice resort. The focus in not in the latest coolest Instagram design. The focus is on sustainability with using nature materials. So, everything is made from wood, without missing any amenities. All switches in the room are placed, where they should be (including description), plenty international plugs, sound system in- and outside. We liked the design of the villa very much, especially the sinks and the glass bottom in the toilet. When arriving, you get a bag to put in your shoes. It is a barefoot island üòä.   For a green resort they try to minimize the green footprint much as possible. They harvest their own grocery, have chicks and island water supply. Of course, this isn‚Äôt enough to run all restaurants on the resort, but it is a step in the right direction. Overall,‚Ä¶"
"We stayed at Six Senses Laamu for 6 nights, this being our fourth trip to the Maldives. Although we had wonderful stays at other resorts in the past, we were open for a new experience, at the same time we went in with not too high expectations.  Prior to arriving, we had some issues with our reservation not being confirmed as half board. After a (not so helpful) conversation with the reservations team, eventually Zuhoor was able to offer a feasible solution. Nevertheless, this was our most expensive holiday in the Maldives so far paying almost $9,500 for the 6 nights transfers included (lagoon water villa, half board).  Our expectations, although they were not high overall, were exceeded in some areas (overwater villa layout, the food and the island itself). But in other areas‚Ä¶"
"Incredible resort : luxury and humility at the same time. Sustainibility and yet everything you need for a wonderfull vacation. Housing are amazing in every detail (the transparent bath tube over a transparent floor over the water is something unique!). The view and those 50 shade of blues are so beautiful! Special thanks to our  Guest Experience Maker,  Ashraq, who took very good care of us and made sure that our stay at six senses would be unforgettable.  We'll definitely try other six senses resort over the world is we have the chance."
"We spent a wonderful honeymoon on Olhuveli at Six Sense. A dreamlike island, highly recommended despite a longer journey. The facilities are extremely nice  and good styled (beach villa with pool). Perfect for a honeymoon!  The food and cuisine are excellent. We liked especially The leaf and the Zen Restaurant. The breakfast buffet is second to none.  The excellent and very nice staff read every wish from our lips without being intrusive. We would especially like to mention our very dear GEM Ninni with perfect English, who took care of us professionally, lovingly and personally and did everything to make our vacation perfect! A thousand thanks for that!   Finally: Perfect dream vacation of the top class, which leaves nothing to be desired!"
"Six Senses in Laamu, Maldives has to be the holiday of a lifetime (No, I‚Äôm serious)!! Me and wife visited here for our honeymoon and had the best time ever (again, I‚Äôm serious)!! It‚Äôs hard to write into words how perfect the trip has been but I‚Äôll make a small attempt now. From start to finish everything has been perfect for us. The food and drink have been insanely good, the all staff (certain names to follow) have been incredible, the activities (again which ones to follow) have been so much fun. The whole resort has been immaculate, extremely hard to fault!! We did so many activities, all of them were really in-depth and knowledgeable. The ones that stood out for us were firstly the guided snorkel with Afaaz (complimentary), then more sea grass snorkeling and further in-depth‚Ä¶"
"I have visited the Maldives a few times but this trip to Laamu Six Senses tops them all! The staff and the island itself, envelops you the moment you arrive, making you feel completely at home. We were looked after by the unbelievably all rounded wonderful and (multi talented) Shah who made sure our honeymoon was just perfect. From start to finish, Shah was there for our every need and want and went above and beyond for us. I couldn‚Äôt recommend him more or speak higher of him - he really is the best of the best. We love you Shah! We enjoyed so many incredible experiences whilst staying on the island including a beautiful sunrise dolphin dhoni boat ride and a Maldivian cooking course with Dilshan, who‚Äôs knowledge of Maldivian and Sri Lankan cooking has ensured we can take our‚Ä¶"
"Had a fabulous 9 days at Six Senses.  Food, service and overall experience were excellent.  Shah (our Gem) was great - really enthusiastic, helpful and attentive.   Ali (marine biologist and host of our sunset dolphin trip) was super knowledgeable and great company.  Loved every minute!"
"It was a great week for me and my husband; we celebrated our anniversary and my birthday as well. All of the hotel staff is great and friendly. Especially Shah, who cared with us is amazing; he helped us lot and guaranteed  that we had a wonderful time here. Thanks to Six Sense Laamu for the hospitality and made amazing experience for us!"
"We stayed at Six Senses Laamu for a week and amazed with the quality of service, cleaning and location. Stayed in a water villa (highly recommended) and had the chance to do reef and seagrass snorkeling sessions directly from our villa. our guest experience manager Shah helped us with everything we needed and always filled out us with detailed information."
"My husband and I had the most amazing honeymoon at Six Sense Laamu- it was truly at trip of a lifetime for us! The resort was was beyond our expectations with AMAZING service, unbelievable overwater layout, breathtaking beach bungalow with pool (the room type we stayed at), spectacular snorkeling (the coral and underwater marine life was something out of a Disney movie), beautiful uncrowded waves (my husband and I both surf, so that was a focus of the trip), and creative/unique delicious food! Our wonderful GEM, Thohir, dialed in our stay for us, including the COVID testing we needed to get back into the USA, all of our reservations, and was available for any question we might have. Thohir was truly and asset to making our trip smooth and worry-free! The resort was the most‚Ä¶"
"Amazing Place, extraordinary rooms and  the service is outstanding, our GEM Abdulla make our week perfect!!! If you want to have a peaceful and enjoyable time together, this is the place!!! The food is great, the water sports(snorkel, tours, scuba, caiaque) are amazing!"
My daughter and I had the most amazing experience at Six Senses Laamu.  Every aspect of our vacation was given special attention by our GEM Shah and we left with the most fond memories.  We will surely return again and highly recommend!
"My partner and I recently spent a week at Six Senses Laamu, which we found to be simply the best resort we‚Äôve ever stayed at. Our experience was incredible from start to finish.   The resort encapsulates barefoot luxury, which begins on the boat transfer to the island where we were invited to remove our shoes and given a bag to keep them in for the rest of the holiday (eating fine dining barefoot is quite something!).  The island itself and accommodations are stunning. We stayed in a Laamu Water Villa which has amazing ocean views, a beautiful interior, and every amenity that you could ask for ‚Äì leaving the impression that everything has been carefully considered to optimise the guest experience. The outdoor shower and glass bottom bathtub are highlights and we regularly spotted‚Ä¶"
"This was our second trip to six senses laamu. This time we stayed for two weeks and it went just as quickly as one week. We had an amazing time. All the staffs were very nice & treated us royalty. The food again was superb with a huge choice & every meal time was different. There was never a time you cannot find something you like. It was very relaxing & peaceful. We would recommend to organize a night snorkeling as this give a completely different experience as fishes often heads towards the torches so you can get close up personal with marine life. Our special thanks to our Gem Aslah for organizing everything for us, the bar & restaurant staffs (Can‚Äôt remember all the names) and our villa attendant Samah. We were very sad to leave the island, we felt it was our get away, we‚Ä¶"

"My wife and I celebrated our honeymoon at Six senses laamu Maldives & then followed up with a second visit for our anniversary.  This was by far one of the best hotels we have stayed in.  the staff are very attentive to your needs and requests. Our GEM Aslah was always checking on us and made sure everyone is having a good time. The rooms are spacious and well appointed.  The dining options are fantastic with many restaurants offering a variety of local and international cuisine. Our favorite was Zen restaurant, which gives the most amazing views and dining experience.  Six senses laamu..simply amazing!"
"We had a wonderful & relaxing time in six senses laamu and a beautiful holiday. Beautiful small island, gorgeous beach and warm sea. Comfortable clean and spacious accommodation. A good selection of delicious good food in all the restaurants. Friendly and helpful staffs. Special to mention our Gem Aslah who was very kind & helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. The weather was perfect but was very hot. Not the island's fault."
"Just returned home after a long journey. I had to say six senses laamu was far by the best resort we have stayed. Just so friendly and great with the kids. The island is pristine, and even though it was nearly at capacity, it almost seemed deserted. The food was excellent in all restaurants & with great choices. Drinks are a bit expensive, which we knew they would be. If you are planning to visit the Maldives, and want pure relaxation and indulgence, look no further. Special shout out our GEM Aslah & to Aiman, who looked after our room for the week, such a lovely man. We would definitely return to this amazing island"
"There is no other escape for us other than SixSenses Hotels, and the Maldives location is above and beyond the BEST!  MAGICAL!  Our GEM, Shah, made sure our experience was exceptional!  He made ALL of our reservations for EVERYTHING, and always with a big smile!  We surfed multiple breaks with Saif and Umar, our outstanding surf gurus who deserve a promotion and a raise!  Top notch!  The exotic free ice cream is such a treat!  The restaurants are diverse and the Sushi restaurant, Zen,  changes it‚Äôs menu according to the freshest catch of the day!  Our server. Mike, at the Chill restaurant, was lovely!  The Sun is super strong, so wear sunscreen and rash guards!  No joke!  Treat yourself to a massage or two!  Shani from Thailand, was AMAZING!     The Maldives Six Senses is‚Ä¶"
Six Senses Laamu had been on our travel list for quite some time and our visit didn‚Äôt disappoint. The sunrises and sunsets were spectacular! Our over water bungalow was very comfortable with an extended deck to enjoy the magnificent views and feel the tropical vibes. The food at their different restaurants was excellent. Really great staff made sure that everything we needed was taken care of including Aslah our GEM and Totto at Chill Bar. Being able to snorkel with sea turtles at the coral reef just meters off the resort and then a leisurely sit down for lunch without skipping a beat was a top experience. Highly recommend!
"Once you arrive on this beautiful island you will forget about the long trip which took us almost 24hrs! From the day one until your departure you will be looked after by GEMs, who will make sure everything is perfect-all your dinners pre-planned, advised daily activities, most of the activities are complementary, and here I need to accept that I was speechless!                                               Everything was just amazing. All workers were so kind , helpful and super friendly. Our GEM Ainuraüíé went far beyond to make our stay memorable! Thank you so much! Xxx"
"We had the best stay in this amazing hotel, we learned a lot about the sea/oceans and the whole Blue Marine Conservation Foundation... I have to give special thanks to our GEM, Shah... he is absolutely amazing a great person who took great care of us and my mother."
"I just loved every piece of our vacation time at Six Senses Laamu. Starting with our great GEM, who was a real piece of jewerly, Stephany until the very last moment having ice cream on the speed boat. Me and my hubsand could enjoy half surf trip half honey moon. The susteinability legitimate part of the resort is also fantastic. The back of the house tour with Vadi was amazing too."
"Excellent trip, just what we needed after the last couple of years.  Relaxing, Comfort, swimming, dining, snorkeling, followed by spa treatments. we found this resort with variety of different types of villas. The food was diverse. Excellent choices of restaurants, the best home made ice cream complimentary all day was our favorite part. Amazing & friendly staffs..To hight light our Gem Aslah, our villa attended Shifam, Izaaz from dive centre & many more. It was a Bliss"
"We went to six senses laamu for our honeymoon & it was everything we could have ever hoped for, it is obvious from the moment you arrive to this resort island that you are in a beautiful island with barefoot. The resort makes you at home right from the start. You are literally encouraged to work barefoot & allowing the staffs to handle anything for you. We found very convenient not to even have phone calls & look for staffs when needing something. we simply had to message over on watsapp. Food was delicious & filled with varieties. The host we were assigned to was Gem Aslah, he was very helpful & kind to answer any questions. We were been looked after really well. The resort handled the accommodations in regards to covid testing for departure aswell. we hope to return soon"
Beautiful resort with the best foods and staffs. We would like to say a big thank you to every single person who made our stay at six senses laamu so memorable. Specially our Gem Aslah. Who was a real Gem. Water sports and snorkeling was very much exciting too. Thank you all
"We recently returned from our one week honeymoon stay at the Six Senses Laamu and we can't recommend it enough! The resort itself is absolutely stunning and the most memorable place we've ever visited. As we were on the boat heading to the airport at the end of the trip, my husband and I were already discussing a return visit because we loved the resort and the staff so much. Our GEM, Shah, was amazing and assisted with everything we could ask for. Shah would visit us multiple times throughout the day to check in and whenever we had a request, Shah responded immediately and accommodated without issue. We loved talking with the food & beverage manager, Laurence, who very nicely set up a special lunch for us before our departure because we were missing the Asian market dinner‚Ä¶"
"We had the pleasure of visiting Six Senses Laamu this past March for 8 nights. This was our 14th unique island visit in the Maldives.   Going into this trip, I was a bit apprehensive of Six Senses given some alarming aerial shots that showcased poor beaches and a scary looking black lagoon. After coming back, I can say that some of worries were over exaggerated, and we ended up having an absolutely amazing time at six senses given the lovely villas and amazing atmosphere. this, however, doesn‚Äôt take away from the fact that some aspects of SSL were underwhelming and ideally would need to be addressed before considering a return trip given the high prices. ¬† What we LOVED:  ¬† ROOMS ¬† The rooms at Six Senses Laamu are - in my opinion - a work of art and represent some of the best‚Ä¶"
The experience was amazing. Perfect view & weather. Heart warming welcome people & beautiful island. It Was a pleasure to stay in this resort. The staffs were very lovely and very helpful. special thanks to our Gem Aslah. We had an amazing time & will.definetly be back.
One of the most amazing trips and places I have ever been to. The place was so beautiful it took my breath away and you could never imagine such luxury on the water! We stayed in a beautiful water villa and the staff were so friendly. We had an amazing GEM called Ainura who was so helpful and kind and nothing was ever a problem. She organised our trip so beautifully and I will have memories of it forever. I can‚Äôt wait to go back!
"Where to begin?  The island, the bungalows, the food, the snorkeling and most of all, the staff were absolutely beyond my wildest dreams. Shah, our GEM, took very good care of us, as did everyone else. The view from our overwater villa was mesmerizing and totally relaxing. One of the best Japanese restaurants I have ever eaten at was Zen and the food at Leaf was heavenly. The house reef 30 meters from the dock produced more than 5,000 various fish in less than a half an hour while snorkeling. Throw in free delicious ice cream (48 flavors) in the afternoon and you will wonder if you are indeed in heaven. I could go on and on but the question I get asked the most is, ‚ÄúWould you go back?‚Äù  In a heartbeat!"
"This is was our 9th property in The Maldives and a celebration for a 25th anniversary. Great care went in to choosing the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù room and property. As ‚Äúyou‚Äù know, researching where to stay is insane. Once ‚Äúyou‚Äù factor location, room type, amenities, other reviews, pictures, food, excursions, etc.; the final decision often becomes one of great trepidation for anyone.   THE FOOD ‚Äì PURE HEAVEN. Thank you talented chef‚Äôs and kitchen personnel for all offerings. The detail, taste, creativity, ambiance, quality, presentation were award winning. Our favorites were the ""market themed"" nights as well as Zen. The food at Six Senses IS the best in all of The Maldives; so much so that the difference between #1 and #2 is as vast as comparing #2 to #100.   THE DEVOTION TO THE EARTH ‚Äì JUST‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses Laamu is the dream! We stayed for 4 days and just wish we had longer. The island is beautiful and the staff couldn‚Äôt do more for us. Our GEM Shah was fantastic, he was so attentive and made the whole stay feel completely seamless as he was on hand to help with anything we needed at any time.  Would highly recommend and we hope to return again soon‚Ä¶ for longer!"
"Six Senses Laamu delivers vacation perfection again. This is our second time on the island and we were not disappointed. After the most amazing stay in december we just couldnt stay away for longer than a couple months. Coming back to the island felt like coming home‚Ä¶ Our incredible gem Ainura was waiting to welcome us back, and as soon as we stepped foot on the island we   knew we would be well taken care off. As i said in my last review also, the staff really makes the difference here. There is not a single staff member in Six Senses Laamu that disappoints. What an extremely talented, intellegent, hardworking, positive, genuine and fun group of people. (The list of adjectives to describe could go on and on but you get it) The atmosphere is so warm and comfortable, and that is‚Ä¶"
"My husband and I just returned from a 5-night stay at Six Senses Laamu. Expectations were high just based on reviews here, but our experience blew every expectation out of the water. It was beyond perfect in just about every way!   From the moment we got off the plane in Male, we felt so incredibly well-taken care of by Six Senses staff and greeters at every point along the way. This was particularly appreciated as we were visiting for the first time, and exhausted from the long hours of travel. Smiling faces and an extra hand with baggage and directions really went a long way.  Our arrival at the resort felt straight out of a movie. The GM and other staff were gathered to give us a warm welcome to the island. After a brief overview and round of intros, we were introduced to our‚Ä¶"
"We just returned from our honeymoon in Six Senses Laamu and could have not chosen a more perfect location.  The setting was one of the most beautiful locations we had ever been in. Crystal blue water, gorgeous grounds and villas that were the perfect combinations of being so well thought out and beautiful without being overly fussy. This speaks to the entire setting at Six Seneses. Nothing felt overly manicured, they allow the natural beauty of the island to come through but also take such care to make it one of the most comfortable and relaxing settings you could imagine.  The team at Six Senses was also amazing. Going out of their way to be helpful at each step and helping us to make the most of our time away with no stresses. Our Guest Experience Manager (GEM) was Stephany‚Ä¶"
"This is my family‚Äôs second trip to the Maldives and the third stay over a Six Senses Resort (Qingcheng, Yao Noi). And in all ways the best experience so far.   Besides the usual quality of facilities, food, and services of what you would expect from a Six Senses resort, the connection that we made over the 8 days with the environment and the people here, made possible by Six Senses‚Äô sustainable philosophy, was all so much more memorable.   While able to enjoy diving, snorkeling, or relaxing on the perfect beaches and lovely villas, which many reviewers have written about, the sustainability oriented way of living and activities provided by the resort and the NGO it hosts was inspiring and informative to us. The marine biologist talks were so good that they were always fully‚Ä¶"
"If you‚Äôve been looking for paradise, look no further. This is it: a winning combination of clear warm water and reefs teeming with tropical fish, lush tropical vegetation and stylish villas built over the water, access to every conceivable water sport and delicious food. Both me and my husband and our 2 12-year old grandsons pampered and entertained in equal measure. Not least because of our friendly, energetic and efficient GEM (Guest Experience Maker) Shah who saw to it that our every need, wish and whim was satisfied. I would have liked to be able to add a 6th star to my rating to acknowledge the wonderful service  provided by Shah and all the other friendly people at Six Senses Laamu."
"We spent 2wks  at Laamu.  It was our 6th trip to Maldives, and Laamu we selected because our dive buddies had told us Laamu offers very good diving. The concept is excellent - sustainability in focus - we learned a lot how they support loca people and fishermen.  The villas - very lovely. I wished for Jetty A but was actually happy to stay at JettyC, much better. With bikes it took only 5 min to restaurant. So much privacy and turtles in front of our villa.  The people: Our very special thanks to all people.  Our GEM Shah was always ready to help us and and was interested seeing our dive pics everyday.  I cannot remenber all names, but the staff at Chill - they learned the 2nd night our favorite drinks and the ""regulars"" were already coming when we entered into the bar.  The‚Ä¶"

There are breath taking views everywhere you look, the food is phenomenal and the staff were incredible.  The staff were so attentive and kind, they made our stay that much more enjoyable. We miss them already!   We loved hearing about all the eco initiatives happening on and around the island. It‚Äôs amazing the work Six Senses Laamu are doing around sustainability, education and conservation.   A special shout-out to our Gem, Shihan. I could spend all day raving about him.

"Our family recently stayed at Six Senses Laamu (""SSL"") for ~1 week and we had a wonderful experience.  It was our first stay at a Six Senses Resort and we left impressed and eager to try other locations (or return to SSL again haha).  We've been to the Maldives before (pre-kids!) and this time we prioritized spacious, family friendly accommodation/facilities as well as an island that offered an eco-centric experience the whole family could enjoy.  To that end, SSL delivered in spades.  First, our resort experience was phenomenal with our Guest Experience Manager (""GEM""), Shihan, coordinating everything for our family.  He was professional, well prepared and responsive to our queries, but most importantly he was super patient and friendly with our family.  We have a young family‚Ä¶"
"I can't think of anything that could have improved our stay, it was perfect throughout. It is the most beautiful place and an amazingly well run hotel. Our Gem Thohir was fantastic and could not have been nicer or more helpful. Will hopefully be coming back soon!"

The choice of bars & restaurants are excellent & the island it self is stunning. This was our first visit to the Maldives & certainly won't be the last. If you want complete luxury in paradise, this is your place."
"This holiday was incredible from start to finish. Abdulla, our Gem, greeted us at the airport and was  available for anything we required. He kept us up to speed with our itinerary and booked anything we required.   Our rooms were serviced twice daily and the staff we so friendly and approachable.   Tropic Surf gave us an awesome experience surfing Turtles everyday. Hamish and Uma were so patient and encouraging and Holly was so friendly.   Couldn‚Äôt fault Six Senses resort. It was magical! Definitely a must on your bucket list if you like great food and service, surf, day spas, water sports and warm weather in a picturesque location. The colour of the sand and water is next level!"
Absolutely incredible service & amenities. All the staffs were very helpful & Kind..Our Gem Aslah was very much helpful through out out stay. The food was the best we have had anywhere & it was a joy to stay here. We stayed in a water villa facing towards the sunset & nothing compared to the beauty during the sunset time. Counting for the next visitüôè
i travel a lot & this is the best resort i have ever been to. From birthday cakes to great customer service. Shout out to our Gem Aslah. All the staffs deserve a five star but he deserves an accolade. food was great. From the boat ride from the airport to last minute of our stay everything was exceptional. i will definitely come back
"the hotel is really a peace of heaven on earth, the beauty of the beach with its white sands, the crystal clear water & the cozy room were top notch. The amazing foods in all the restaurants were delicious. Excellent service from the staffs. Special to mention our Gem Aslah who organized everything for us & thought of every small details in advance. It was hard to leave this paradise."
"Where do I start? From the moment we were picked up at Kadhdhoo airport by our GEM (Guest Experience Maker) Abdulla, to the very last moment of the trip, our experience was wonderful.   The resort itself is out of this world with mindblowing views, the most delicious food (every single meal) and exceptional service from all staff. Special mention goes to our GEM Abdulla who made every aspect of our trip memorable and who went above and beyond to make sure we had an amazing time. Also our Tropic Surf instructors, Holly, Hamish, Umar and Saif -  who were out there with us every day, providing excellent advice and making sure we had an epic time. Housekeeping, spa, wait staff and marine biologists were all fantastic also.   Our accommodation (overwater villa) was exceptional and‚Ä¶"

We absolutely love our stay & had a great honeymoon stay. we highly recommend this hotel !  Ps. Find Gem Aslah as your gem, he is amazing:"
"The most blissful & heavenly 5 days. This place is a dream, it is visually stunning, the staff are all incredibly helpful, the food is exquisite & the accommodation is idyllic. Staffs are very friendly..Special to mention our Gem Aslah was very kind & helpful..We will surely come back..Thank to all"
"Wow, where do I start? My group of friends and I had the best time! Ate, drank, slept, relaxed and last but not least, surfed!  The moment we met Abdulla our GEM (Guest Experience Maker) at Kadhdhoo Airport, we knew we were in for the most amazing experience.   Abdulla met us with the largest smile and wave, then guided us onto our boat. From that moment and throughout our entire stay, everything was a breeze, no worries and so much fun!   Our accommodation was second to none! Overwater villa was spectacular and I woke up in a postcard every day!   All the staff from the welcome and introductions to the massages we received, housekeeping and wait staff were exceptional.   Tropic surf really know how to pick a bunch of legendary instructors and Hamish, Holly, Umar and Saif did‚Ä¶"
"From start to finish this trip was incredible! The resort was so beautiful and full of lovely staff, who were so helpful and welcoming.  Nothing to fault about this trip or this resort.  Our ‚ÄúGEM‚Äù (Shaha) made our honeymoon the best it could ever have been! He always made time to see us personally everyday, gave us the best (and most realistic) recommendations for activities & food and in general went above and beyond for us everyday. It would not have been the same without our lovely ‚ÄòGEM‚Äô Shaha!   Also, breakfasts here are great & I would just like to thank the lovely lady from India who made our pancakes fresh everyday and memorised our order - she was so sweet & made our mornings :)   I would definitely recommend the Sunset Water Villa. Gorgeous views no matter the time of‚Ä¶"
I‚Äôve travelled around the world and I must say that this resort tops the lot. All the staff are so friendly and helpful from the start as well as there being a lot of fun and adventurous activities available to you. Shaha was brilliant! Always checked up on us and made the whole experience smooth and relaxed. Very thoughtful in how he planned all of our activities and gave us a honeymoon we could of never of dreamed off. Even at breakfast there was a staff member from India who always had our pancakes ready for us and it‚Äôs those little things that make you feel at home when you‚Äôre on the other side of the world. So sad when we had to leave but will definitely be heading back ASAP. Thank you to everyone at Six Senses and see you all soon :)
"Thanks to all of the staff for a fantastic stay at Six Senses resort Laamu, from the moment that you step onto the arrival jetty you are warmly welcomed and immediately relax. We stayed for a week and really enjoyed the selection of activities and dining options.   The resort itself is stunning and the wildlife is incredible, we had many close encounters with dolphins and turtles! Special thanks go out to our GEM (Shah) who was the perfect host and arranged everything we wanted leaving us wanting for nothing, we hope to see him again.  We spent many relaxed hours at Chill Bar enjoying the stunning view and sunset, again the bar staff were brilliant, special thanks to Nazeeh who kept the Lion draft flowing and kept us informed with lots of information about the local area and‚Ä¶"
"Amazing stay with best staffs..food was perfect.,Diving was great & spa was the best experience we had..we will come back soon..Special to mention our Gem Aslah who organized everything perfect for us..see you"
"We had an amazing five nights at six senses. The overwater bungalows were breathtaking, the food everywhere was delicious and the staff were next level. Special thanks to Abdulla, Hamish, Holly, Umar and everyone else who went out of their way to make out trip unforgettable!"
"My friends and I had the most magical stay here. The food, the surroundings, the sustainability practices and especially our GEM (guest experience maker) Abdulla! He deserves 10 out of 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è for being wonderful, making us all feel so welcome, for effortlessly organising us and all our activities and dinner reservations. Hamish, Uma, Saif and Holly from the surf school were fantastic also. We had so much fun out in the surf and felt so safe. Already thinking about rebooking!"
"Six senses Laamu is amazing!! From arrival to departure we were made to feel very special and welcome. Not only is this destination absolutely beautiful, the accommodation is wonderful. We have a week in a water villa and a week in the beach villa. Each had its own unique Maldivian charm. The staff really were second to none. I would like to list them all as each and everyone of them always had a wonderful cheery smile to greet us every time we see them!! Our lovely Gem Aslah, helped us with everything and nothing was ever too much trouble. Some of those I‚Äôd like to mention, The sommelier Kadum, Gem abdula the cocktail guys, Kavish and Sagur and warren.:  Leanna and her lovely smiles,  Akshum our lovely Breakfast waiter and also our lobster eve waiter  Jylam, Noah for a lovely‚Ä¶"
"A stay at Six Senses Laamu infiltrates you attitude. It might creep up on you slowly, it might slam into you the moment you take your shoes off (encouraged by staff) and feel the sand between your toes for the first time and for the duration of your stay. Whether you be stressed out, preoccupied, distracted or disengaged eventually you will succumb to ‚ÄòLaamutude‚Äô ‚Äì a perfect state of well being and happiness.  For us in 5 stages.  From the moment we were greeted off our international flight into Male and whisked first to a lounge to await our onward transfers we knew we had made the right choice with Laamu.  The transfers were well executed and the final boat ride to the island whilst sipping homemade lemonade was joy ‚Äì fresh air, a sea breeze and a sense of excitement at what‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses Laamu is the most beautiful place on the planet! We have just returned from our holiday of a lifetime and it exceeded expectations in every way.   The setting, the rooms, the food, all of it complete perfection.  The attention to detail is second to none. But ultimately it's the staff that make the resort. They were all attentive, polite, and offered the best service I have ever received in a hotel. But still managing to keep a very relaxed an easy going atmosphere, something that I think is very hard to achieve.  I have to give a special mention to our GEM Shah, he appeared as if by magic with a ride home if it was raining, medicine when my daughter was ill and was on hand to make the perfect holiday even more perfect.  He was brimming with local knowledge about the‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses Laamu fully (and above) lived up to our expectations and the ""down to earth"" motto fully describe our stay.  Food, service, Villas, snorkeling were all super good and we will for sure come back in the future and can highly recommend this place ""heaven on earth"""
"Just returned from 12 nights at this amazing resort. We stayed in a sunset water villa, jetty A. The best! From arriving at the local airport and being greeted by the Six senses staff the experience begins, your shoes get removed on the boat, deliciously cold flannels and homemade lemonade to refresh you. On arrival you are given your own GEM, your personal guest experience maker. They take care of as much or as little as you require them to, anything from getting you fresh ice cubes, pumping up your bike tyres, booking the restaurants, anything! just a tap on your what's ap or a phone call from the room and its sorted. My husband scuba dived and had an amazing time diving in the channels of the reef around the atoll -Nick from the dive centre was great, he took lots of footage‚Ä¶"
"To be honest we were a little bit nervous about going to the Six Senses Lamuu based on the fact that it looked a little bit rustic and not extremely luxurious like some of the other resorts that we had looked at, that being said the activities and the sustainable approach made the resort appealing.  Turned out we were completely wrong and when we arrived at our beach lagoon villa w/ pool, we were very pleasantly surprised by the quality and the amenities provided.  As soon as we arrived on the island we were greeted by our guest experience manager Abdullah who was literally the most amazing host and definitely one of the reasons which makes us want to come back to the Six Senses. Abdullah took care of synchronizing every single dining reservation, activity, purchase and spa‚Ä¶"
"Spent 10 days at this amazing place and everything was top notch!   Me and my family stayed in two water villas, which were spacious and very tastefully decorated. The cleaning and service around the villa was handled perfectly!   The food was very good! We usually ate lunch at Chillbar or SipSip. The restaurants offered both lighter alternatives in the form of super fresh salads or more nutritious alternatives in the form of delicious sourdough pizzas or burgers. My personal favorite was the theme nights held at the Longitude restaurant! Especially the Asian streetmarket-theme! Everything was so amazingly good!   If you like underwater life, then this is the place for you! There is a fantastic house reef just outside Chillbar. I did a couple of dives and the dive center and‚Ä¶"
"We had the great fortune of staying at Six Senses for our honeymoon.  It was absolutely perfect and did not disappoint. Each day was better than the last. Special shout out to Abdullah, our gem, whose dedication and attention throughout our stay ensured we were always taken care of. We would be so lucky to stay here again!  "
It was one of the best trips of my live. The place was insanely beautiful and the service great. Stephany our Gem and Danny from the divers center were impecable! Would definitely come back to this hotel
"We visited six senses laamu for 4 days for our honeymoon. Recently Covid issue has occurred but we have got vaccinated & took care of us. Resort has absolute precautionary measures for Covid.  It was a fantastic stay. Everyday we spent was unforgettable. Weather was very nice. Our GEM Aslah was so warm hearted, kind and has always a smiling face with patience in arranging our daily activities & other plans. We had a wonderful time & really wants to visit again someday."
"The Maldives has been on our wish list for quite some time and March 2022 it finally happened. We were welcomed by the team and general manager Marteyne van Well whom was not only welcoming but was very approachable through our stay. All the staff at Laamu respect Marteyne, they are very friendly, always smiling and calm. We was assigned our Gem - Aslah for our entire stay who was on the end of a WhatsApp message to fulfil all our needs from snorkelling equipment to restaurant bookings to spa appointments to scuba diving. He was a true gem üíé. We was very fortunate to attend a group with Marteyne, Anne (Diving team Manager) and Kush (my diving buddy) one morning early to meet the underwater life by boat to a reef. It was so highly organised, we had nothing to do but arrive at‚Ä¶"
"From the moment we touched down in Male we were scooped up by the expert and attentive team from Six Senses. Once on the speed boat to Laamu, a little jaded from the long journey so far, with broad smiles we were offered fresh lemonade and a canvas bag to pop our shoes into... we didn't put shoes back on until our return to the airport - barefoot luxury, it really is.  Having previously stayed at Six Senses Koh Yao Noi we knew our holiday was likely to be at the cutting edge of 5-star hospitality but Six Senses Laamu exceeded all our expectations. With breathtaking beauty and understated luxury, close attention to detail, delicious food, and superb personal service, we found ourselves in an utterly private and welcoming oasis. The staff were faultless... Sanaah, Hussain, Bo and‚Ä¶"
"Cliche as it is we had the most incredible honeymoon in Laamu and had the fantastic GEM Stephany to guide and look after us. The food is exceptional with firm favourites being ZEN and Leaf, plus the food markets they put on at Longitude, so much choice and all to incredibly high standards and quality. No ask was too big. We got to enjoy snorkelling with a guide and at our own leisure and saw ray and turtles which was the most wonderful experience. Our complimentary massages at the spa were fantastic and I wish I had discovered this sooner! We even frequented the gym and did yoga which was such a treat and were one of a few in each class. All the staff are exceptionally friendly, helpful and happy. There are so many things on offer and a huge array of choice for those who want to‚Ä¶"
"We have just left Six Senses Laamu and are heading home after 12 days on the island.  We‚Äôre sad to be leaving behind the beautiful setting, the always sensationally delicious food (you really can depend on it, at all restaurants, bars and via room service) and the many fun things to do but most of all, we‚Äôre sad to say goodbye to the people we met.    Everybody working on Laamu was kind, friendly and helpful. Our GEM (Guest Experience Manager) was Aslah. He is an impressive man. He made us feel like nothing was too much trouble. Things we asked for arrived or happened at the drop of a hat. Most importantly of all for us though, he was very good at looking after our autistic 3 year old boy. They struck up a friendship. Rides in the (golf) buggy up to breakfast with Aslah were a‚Ä¶"
"Visited Laamu this March.   This was our 5th visit to the Maldives and this resort far exceeded the experience we had in the other 4.  From the moment we landed in Male, their staff were there to help us firstly to get to the domestic terminal and check in for the short flight and then to board the speed boat to the resort.   Everything was very smooth.   On arrival we were given a quick briefing and then introduced to our GEM, Shah.  He had already put together some thoughts for dinner locations so that we could at least get to visit all the restaurants if we wanted.  He was our primary contact whilst there and did a fantastic job arranging anything from massages to presentations.    We had a sunset water villa on jetty A.   This was an ideal location, close enough to the house‚Ä¶"
"We had a wonderful time at the Six Senses Resort. Besides the stunning nature and perfect weather, there was never a dull moment. There are plenty of activities to do and many different cuisines and restaurants to try. The food is truly exceptional, always fresh and so delicious. Every single staff member is very polite and welcoming, the service is outstanding. The attention paid to sustainability is also remarkable. We stayed with the entire family, having booked both a beach and water villa and both were beautiful. Our guest experience manager, Abdulla, was wonderful. He responded to every request immediately and always made sure to fulfill our requests and wishes. This has been our second time staying here and we will definitely come back."
"This place is literally paradise on earth, and with the very best service imaginable. So many smiling faces and our GEM Aslah made the barefoot luxury concept run like clockwork from behind the scenes. Nowhere better on the planet that we‚Äôve seen. thank you"
"I really don‚Äôt know where to begin. I couldn‚Äôt have imagined how incredible Laamu is. The island, the people, the food, our stunning water villa, the sunsets and marine life, this place is beautiful. Six Senses is in a league of its own. A huge thank you to Aslah who went above and beyond to look after us."
"Six Senses Laamu exceeded all expectations! Understated, relaxed, sympathetically styled to blend into its natural surroundings‚Ä¶ incredible service by wonderful staff (Aslah was our GEM and he made sure everything was always taken care of!). Our usual holidays are spent travelling around seeing and doing as much as possible, so we were slightly worried we may get bored on just one island. We couldn‚Äôt have been more mistaken. We were made to feel very special throughout our stay and would thoroughly recommend this resort for your honeymoon (or just vacation!)  Thank you to the whole team at Six Senses. This is something we will never forget!"
"While the journey there can be cumbersome (long waiting times in Male), Six Senses Laamu actually blew our minds. The team there is so well trained and equipped to make your stay the most enjoyable and comfortable possible, that after 10 days we cannot share a single flaw. We travel a lot and have been to many great resorts and hotels but this is even better than many Aman Hotels. Six Senses manages to keep you in touch with nature, while not missing any comforts you might know from home. We cannot recommend this hotel enough. Our gem Nura, went above and beyond, always being a step ahead of what we could possibly need. 10 out 5 stars"
"We often visit the Maldives and have visited about 40 hotels in recent years. Do you want to know which is the best hotel? Six Senses Laamu. A magnificent hotel with comfortable villas, excellent service, good beaches and fine cuisine. I would like to thank manager Ainura Kubanibekova for her high professionalism and attentive attitude. We were very glad to meet our friend Naail waiter here again. We would like to thank him for his care and hospitality. We meet with Naail for the third time, he remembers us by name. The nice thing is that without ordering, he brings us exactly the dishes that we ordered a year ago. I think that in the future, Naail will make a very good manager. The hotel has very good restaurants and excellent cuisine. We especially liked the Leaf restaurant.‚Ä¶"
"Couldn‚Äôt wish more!  Amazing holiday at a beautiful resort. Starting from the airport till the departure you feel being taken care of perfectly. To reach the resort you will take a local flight and then a short boat trip. On the way we saw dolphins, it was a WOW welcome! Hotel is eco-friendly, plastic free, with its own herbs garden and mushroom hut! Everything is well arranged. Breakfast at the main restaurant, lunch and dinner offers at different places. DJ plays nice music, and you can enjoy the sunset from the Bar. Ice cream shop is open with 48 flavours till 10:30pm, and it is a must to try all of them! Ocean life is crazy, join the marine biologist snorkeling or Nemo Finding. We saw turtles, sharks, stingrays. From your own villa also can do snorkeling.For the relaxation‚Ä¶"
"A year ago we decided to spend our winter vacation on in Six Senses Laamu again. As we already been here before we asked for particular villa.   As we‚Äôve been sharing our recent impressions and our plans for upcoming year a lot of our friends decided to join us and eventually there were four families and fifteen people in total.   The hotel provides extraordinary experience in terms of accommodation, cuisine, spa, activities and entertainment. And is really important for us all infrastructure is carefully integrated into unique nature of the island - eco chic so to say!  It also hard to overestimate the contribution of the whole team to our vacation experience but we would like to express special thanks to our GEM Ainura, her professionalism and the way she took care of us were‚Ä¶"

"We have just spent a very relaxing week at the amazing Six Senses Laamu, staying in an overwater villa with its own pool. The balance of a relaxed style, wonderful amenities, high quality food and being so wonderfully looked after by Shah made our stay truely memorable."
"Fantastic food, fantasic staff. Our GEM Shah took extremely good care of our family! Accomodation is ecofriendly and topclass. The whole atmosphere is friendly and peaceful a sort of laidback luxury. Serving staff terrific allover, especially Nail that made every breakfast memorable. Our watervilla was always cleaned to perfection thanks to Saleem. I can highly recommend this option for your next Maldivian stay."
"It is really sad to leave this paradise!! We have had a marvellous vacation for 10 days! We stayed in Over-water villas with very comfy beds and wonderful outdoor showers. Everything is very eco-friendly. Our GEM Shah was amazing and did his outmost to serve us in every way. He was always easy to reach via WhatsApp. The staff who took care of the cleaning were also great and we must mention Salim that was always preparing our rooms at the best! The restaurants were great and especially ‚ÄôLeaf‚Äô, where we always had amazing food and good service.

"Had the best time at Six Senses Laamu. Ocean villa was perfect - waking up to a beautiful sunrise every morning was very special. Loved the terrace outside and open air shower. Food was always fantastic and impressively varied. Snorkelling was excellent - saw reef sharks, sting and manta rays, turtles, eels and many tropical fish regularly. Staff are friendly, accommodating and all had an great sense of humour. Many thanks to our GEM, Shah, for making everything run so seamlessly. Would love to come back as soon as possible! "
"We have just got back from 2 weeks in Six Senses Laamu. By far and away the best holiday we have ever had for many reasons. Here are the best bits: - Amazing food every night with lots of different cuisines from the 3 restaurants - fantastic range of activities including yoga , diving, spa, Watersports - unbelievable staff. Everyone we met was very helpful and friendly. Special mention to our GEM (guest experience manager) Shah who was extremely helpful, informative and friendly helping us to make the most of our holiday. He had excellent recommendations for things to see and do and is a real asset.  - phenomenal location. This resort is in south Maldives and has crystal clear water and a coral reef with a huge range of marine life very easily accessible  - dive centre on site.‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses Laamu Atoll is probably the loveliest resort my family and I have experienced anywhere in the world.  And I make this statement as a former US diplomat who has seen his fair share of great (and not so great) places and whose sister lives on Maui.  For the first time in my life, the resort totally met my preconceived notion of what the ideal vacation experience would be.    The architecture of our over-water villa was perfect.  The thatched roof and naturally irregular supporting beams provided a feel of ‚Äúisland authenticity‚Äù while the terraced interior offered a constantly spectacular view of the most vibrant electric turquoise and cobalt blue waters we have ever seen.  And the outdoor shower was amazing, with a ladder next to it leading right into the sea.  The‚Ä¶"
"I stayed in October with my son and returned in February with my best friend to celebrate our 30 years of friendship. That basically says it all‚Ä¶ We had a great stay and love everything about this place. The snorkeling to me is one of the best in the Maldives (both the house reef and the sea grass snorkeling were very rewarding) as is the food, the spa, the yoga classes, the cycling bare foot. But once again what really stands out is the team. Everyone is approaching you with sincere friendliness, nothing seems impossible, flexibility throughout to make the guests 100% happy.

"Fantastic hotel on a beautiful island. Six Senes Laamu effortlessly straddles high end luxury with a relaxed informal ethos. The service was impeccable on every level, yet the 'hosts' (staff) were always friendly, relaxed and happy to chat with us. Our interactions never felt forced or insincere and we made really good friends over the week. A huge thank you to all the hosts both front of house and behind the scenes for making this amazing machine run so smoothly. Plus a special thank you to our 'GEM' Shihan would personified the culture here, he effortlessly organised our day to day bookings, answered any questions and dealt with our requests, often organising things before we had even thought to ask.. He was fun to be around, friendly and made the whole trip that much more‚Ä¶"
"This was our first visit to Six Senses Laamu, travelling with friends who had been before and who couldn't recommend the resort highly enough. We were expecting a treat but nothing prepares you for the sheer beauty of that first impression. The location is absolutely stunning and we love the feeling of space that the layout affords. The property has a natural, rustic feel but is very well appointed, very well maintained and beautifully clean. We had a room halfway along the Jetty and enjoyed the see breeze and the aquamarine views as we pottered along on our bikes. If you love snorkelling and diving this is definitely the place to come as you'll see a huge diversity of marine life. We even witnessed the hatching of a turtles at midnight on one of the beaches, supervised by the‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses Laamu exceeded our expectations. It is a beautiful location with a fantastic house reef and all sorts of activities. The villas are comfortable and spacious and perfect for relaxing in the sun (we had a Laamu Water Villa). The food is incredible - we tried all restaurants and were never disappointed. All the hosts are friendly, kind and attentive. In particular, Ainura - our GEM - took care of our every need and request always smiling (she is a star!) and Shihan made sure our villa was always clean and comfortable. The perfect vacation! Highly recommended."
"Our stay at Six Senses Laamu was nothing short of impeccable! We were greeted upon arrival by our wonderful guest experience manager (GEM) Shah, who welcomed us and showed us all around the island. We stayed in a Laamu water villa with pool, and it was the most wonderful experience to wake up to the sound of the waves, then jump out directly into the sea grass meadows where we frequently found turtles and other amazing wildlife.  Our stay was only enhanced by the insane food at each and every restaurant on the property, and the myriad experiences like scuba diving and sustainability tours. Coordinated by our spectaular GEMs Shah and Hamzath, we had the perfect blend of relaxation and activity.  Six Senses Laamu also has an incredible commitment to sustainability,‚Ä¶"

It‚Äôs difficult to thank everybody but I would like to thank Salim , Riffaht,  Aaim,  Kathoo, in particular.  I would also like to thank Lawrence for the great food his team produced and they are the reason I put on weight (along with all the bacon I ate. )  I think the leaf restaurant is one of the best restaurants In the Maldives   I would like to thank everybody on the island for making our holiday a great success and wish them all the best in the‚Ä¶"
What a beautiful island ! We had a wonderful fortnight at Six senses .  We couldn‚Äôt fault one single thing ! Thank you to all the wonderful staff and especially to our GEM Shihan who put up with our  family of 8 plus a 13 month old toddler with patience and humour!  Food was absolutely delicious and a big thank you to Lawrence  food and beverage manager and all the boys who served us huge breakfasts and evening meals . To Muhey and Akaham especially !  Thank you also to our villa attendant Salim !  Snorkelling was incredible and  we think the high light was  when  four of our family were snorkelling and a pod of dolphins swam by and interacted with them !  Also would like to mention Ali and Mina .  We would love to come back again to this little island Paradise !
Honestly the perfect hotel. It's faultless. Spend 6 nights here and had the most relaxing time. The staff are incredibly attentive (thank you Aslah!) and the food is amazing. I couldn't recommend more highly.
What an incredible 11 nights at six senses laamu. It was better than we ever imagined and will hold a very special place in our hearts. Abdullah was exceptional. He went above and beyond for all our needs and by the end became a good friend. We can‚Äôt thank him enough for making our stay that little more special. Thank you to everyone for the most memorable time and we can‚Äôt wait to come back!!
Stayed at the Six Senses Laamu for 10 days. Every day was different and every day was a wonderful experience. You must have dinner on the sandbank! Staff exceptional with Abdulla a stand out performer. Nothing was ever to much for him. He made the holiday even better.
"We had the most amazing 11 nights of our lives on beautiful Laamu. Waking up every morning to the sound of water lapping against our water villa with nothing but the Indian Ocean surrounding us in all its turquoise glory. The highlight of our stay was our amazing GEM and friend, Abdulla. He regularly went beyond the call of duty to make our stay extra special and it would not have been the same without him. You are a total legend Abdulla!"
Visited Maldives for the first time & we are so happy that we have chosen six senses laamu as our favourite spot after doing our research. Service was incredible. Food was excellent. Staffs were friendly & helpful. A big shout out to our Gem Aslah who was so kind & patient with us. See you guys soon!
"We spent a wonderful time at the Six Senses Laamu resort. Location and views are unbeatable, facilities are awesome, food is from another world (don‚Äôt miss out on the dinner buffets‚Ä¶), and staff are very welcoming and helpful. Particularly our GEM (guest experience manager) Shah, who was an incredible host and made our experience unforgettable. Thanks everyone from Six Senses and thank you Shah for your kindness! Hope to see you soon again!"
"We had a fabulous time at this super luxe resort. Best hotel we have been to. Everything was perfect - from the home grown food to the wonderful accommodation, fabulous snorkelling and gorgeous weather.  Shah, our GEM, went above and beyond to make our stay absolutely perfect.  Thank you!"
"Six Senses Laamu will give you the holiday of a lifetime.    The management go the extra mile to ensure you have the best experience ever and the resort is faultless. The turquoise water and the abundant sea life is what draws you back, but the wonderful staff, delicious food and the fact that everyone has a smile on their face makes this our number one choice of holiday venue.    Just go, you will not regret it."
"My husband and I came to the Six Senses Laamu for our honeymoon and had the most incredible trip and experience. Everything you can imagine is perfect - the food, the hospitality, the natural beauty of the island and the resort, the sustainability efforts, and the overall warmth of the people. We are so sad to be leaving and will recommend this experience to everyone.   Specifically, a few callouts: Our GEM (guest experience manager) Ath-har, was fabulous - he was funny, relaxed, made our travel arrangements a seamless process, and helped us coordinate great activities and meals. He knew exactly what we needed and also gave us the space to explore for ourselves. Thank you so much!  The Ocean Villa is spectacular - we had a sunrise view and swam right in the ocean every day from‚Ä¶"
Out of this world incredible and more. From the moment you arrive at the arrival jetty the entire experience is perfection and magical. Can‚Äôt recommend enough! The food is amazing. The attention to detail and pride taken by the entire staff is thoughtfully curated
One of the most beautiful vacation destianation and hotel I have ever visited. Big thanks to Hamsa who took care of us the entire trip. The best experience was the Private Island picnic. We will definately be back.
"If there is heaven it probably looks like this resort. We took a water villa which beyond was our expectation. The villa was clean, spacious and beautiful. The staffs on the island are super helpful. Special to mention our Gem Aslah who was very much helpful & also gave lots of information about the local islands & also took us for tour of the island to show what the resort offers in terms of doing things in a sustainable way. No wonder why the resort is so famous with what they do. We were amazed & got new ideas too. Foods in all the restaurant were top notch. Can't wait to come again"
"Original travel organised our first trip to the Maldives.  Their knowledge and enthusiasm for the resort influenced our choice and we have had the best holiday in many years.   Our GEM Ainura was there to meet us.  What a great addition she was to our holiday.   Everything was done for us with ease and efficiency.  Our villa was on jetty A where Samah looked after us beautifully and discreetly. The villa was spotless, and we loved the laid back decor  - so relaxing. The house reef  was a fabulous experience.  The preserved sea grass offered us a regular meeting of green turtles, rays and reef sharks as well as smaller versions of the reef fish.  The company should be commended for the decision not to clear the sea grass .  The on site marine biologists were very supportive of‚Ä¶"
"Just on our way back from a wonderful 12 days at Six Senses, Maldives. The staff were truly amazing and nothing was too much for them. A special mention to our GEM Ath-har, who was just amazing. He went above and beyond to ensure all our needs were met, he was a delightful person and made our stay even more special. Also, Dani at the dive centre was amazing who trained me to obtain my Padi certification. The only downsides were the price of wine which was incredibly expensive and the breakfast could have been a lot better in terms of choice and hot food."
"This was our second trip to Six Senses Laamu in the Maldives. We have traveled all over the world and we adore smaller boutique unique luxury properties which truly and genuinely capture the essence, culture, history, spirit, and vitality of its surroundings. Six Senses Laamu is the most incredible property we have ever stayed at over the last several decades of travel in the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is truly a magical paradise. Two weeks truly provides an immersive experience filled with depth allowing us to capture and experience every small detail. Our expectations, which were already high based on our prior stay here and our experiences at other properties around the world, were exceeded on every count. The experience of removing your shoes and placing them in‚Ä¶"
"This was the best holiday I've ever had.   To be honest I didn't have the highest of expectations, I thought there was no way the instagram photos would be anything like the reality. But it is. From sunrise to sunset there's beauty all around you. Up with the sunrise, snorkel off the jetty (there wasn't a single morning I didn't see a turtle, ray, shark and all sorts of fish between jetty A and B, sometimes multiple rays and turtles in the same snorkel.   The choice at breakfast left me for words, if you're vegan like me have no fear, the chefs and the F & B manager Lawrence went above and beyond to cater for me and didn't make me feel like I was a pain (although I probably was). Vegan pancakes for breakfast! My wife (not vegan) also loved the wide array of options.   Abdulla‚Ä¶"
"First the good things. The staff were amazing. Always helpful, always friendly, keen to chat and to make you feel welcome. This also translated into excellent service, and the restaurants were generally excellent with ample choice between the Chill Bar, Sip Sip, Leaf and Zen.  Breakfast at Longitude was fantastic with plenty of healthy food choices as well as the usual decadent options.  BUT‚Ä¶there are a couple of caveats. The theme evenings at the Longitude are seriously over-priced. If you are not on all inclusive rather enjoy the a la carte choices from the other restaurants.  The biggest issue for me was the time taken to get to and from the resort from Male. For example, the day we left we had to get up 8, yes eight, hours before our departure flight from Male. That is‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses Laamu is a true paradise on earth. Every single member of the staff is adorable and the island is incredible. Forget about people saying Maldives are boring‚Ä¶they just went to the wrong place! We strongly value Six Senses Laamu commitment in protecting the environment, the Atoll and the marine life (biologists have a research centre on the island)  Special thanks to our lovely GEM Aslah (Guest Experience Maker) and our sweet diver instructor Elena from Deep Blue Divers who pushed our Maldivian experience to the highest level. Thanks to Anim and Isnay for having made the Sandbank experience unforgettable.   During our stay, we have all worked together to discover the sixth sense :) With Love Alexandra & Guillaume"
An amazing and unforgettable trip! Our GEM Stephany made the difference organizing all the dinners and experiencies! I really recommend the sunrise in the San bank and the pic nic in the island! What surprised us was the marine life! It was possible to see turtles and sharks with the snorkel! In the spa all the meditation and wellness activities were amazing! I want to come back for sure
"We couldn‚Äôt ask for more for our honeymoon. Six senses made us feel so loved and well cared for. All the staff was so gentle and everyone does a perfect job.  the food was amazing in every restaurant. The room was spacious, clean and we had amazing views.   Our GEM Stephany made our stay even more better. She took care of every small  detail and she booked everything we wanted in a perfect way. Turtle hatching was one of the things we saw because of our GEM Stephany is dedicate to her job. And we couldn‚Äôt be more thankful.   Thank you all soo much  I sincerely recommend six senses laamu for a perfect relaxed stay in Maldives."
"Amazing place with amazing team. Six Sense Laamu will be in memory of all of my family like a place that we were happy and where we receive love and care. The hotel is wonderfull, the food is perfect and the nature is unforgettable. Only good memories. Hope come back soon."
"For 9 days we left all thoughts of time and dates back home and escaped into the bewitching world of Six Senses Laamu. What we met at the arrival were a team with big smiles and a wish to make our stay as good as possible - and they certainly succeeded. We had the most amazing stay at this small island where there are something for everyone whether you are into sunbathing, snorkelling, scuba diving, surfing or learning about the impressive initiatives they do for the marine life and environment not just around the island but in the Maldives in general. We stayed in an over-water villa on Jetty C which was nothing short of perfect. Being able to hear the waves underneath you when falling asleep and turtles and eagle rays swimming around your villa made this an unforgettable trip.‚Ä¶"
"We were 9 days at Six Senses and had the most adventurous and magical vacation. The surroundings themselves are some of the most beautiful - including our ocean villa funky and more lived up to all our expectations. Beautiful details and interior all over! All the staff were the most brilliant, sweetest and serviceminded - which made our vacation even more lovely.  We had our own ‚Äògem/butler‚Äô Ainura, who personally made sure everything ran smoothly for us and provided the least we needed 24-7.  The most beautiful and delicious food, best chefs, sweetest waiters and with good humor as we like it. In addition, we also got the most beautiful spa treatments. We very much hope to return!"
"Six Senses as a company seem to set the standard for excellent, unpretentious, friendly service; Six Senses Laamu raises the bar.  We travelled as a family of 5 adults in Feb 2022.  This island paradise has turquoise blue, warm water teaming with fish, dolphins and turtles to swim in, great restaurants with delicious, imaginative food, and a gym / spa / cinema / swimming pool etc. to keep everyone amused....as well as free ice cream!  The service is most efficient and nothing is too much trouble (many thanks to Abdulla, our Guest Experience Manager for all his hard work in making our stay unforgettable).  Management is discreet but visible (thanks Lawrence).  Staff are all friendly and responsive.  Villas are extremely comfortable and most have beautiful views of the reef (see‚Ä¶"
"Influencers, leave your Chanel at home - this hotel is for low key luxury. Come as you are, to dinner in a bathing suit or gym gear (though shorts and a T-shirt are more common) , no one bats an eyelid.   Unpretentious, lovely atmosphere, with great clientele (a lot of English, Scandinavian and Americans when we were there) who are not averse to striking up a chat at the pool.   The staff is incredibly kind and hospitable, so great with our two year old who had the time of her life. It‚Äôs family friendly, but not overtly so - you‚Äôre going to an adults hotel, but it caters well to littles too. Our GEM Ainoora was the sweetest person and no ask was too big.   I highly recommend the spa, you can hear the sea waves lapping on the sand as the gong sends you drifting off to sleep‚Ä¶"
Stunning & luxurious upsclae resort at a private island. The beauty of island is breathtaking. The service is impeccable & the rooms are very clean & comfortable. There is almost sunset while enojoying a drink outside the main bar. We enjoyed every bit of island & the snorkelling. Staffs were very helpful & kind always. Special thanks to our Gem Aslah who was very helpful during our entire stay. we will definetly come back.
"We spent 10 nights on Jetty B in an ocean water villa at this beautiful resort in January 2022, and we loved every minute! It was a truly amazing experience with fantastic food and a lot of activities, i.e snorkling (both by the house reef, at our villa and on trips) surfing trips, fishing trip, exercising in the gym and spa treatments - everything wrapped up in breathtaking surroundings and a fantastic staff. The surroundings everywhere in the resort are kept impeccably and beautifully 24/7.  The Six Senses experience starts already before you arrive at the resort: At Male Airport and next Kadhdhoo Airport, we were met by Six Senses handling everything for us regarding luggage, check-in etc.   Upon the arrival on the boat at the resort, we got a warm and hearty welcome by the‚Ä¶"
"Everyone at the resort was so kind and wanted to make sure everything was good for us. Aslah was a fantastic GEM and helped take great care of us. The rooms are beautiful, the water is the most amazing blue, the food is delicious, you can‚Äôt really go wrong here. This is one of the first resorts I really hope to come back to!"
Six Senses Laamu is such an incredible place. We stayed on Jetty A in a Lagoon Water Villa in Villa 32 and it was awesome. Originally I thought maybe the water would be too shallow but it's definitely deep enough to dive in although it is not recommended.  Wildlife: Our first day we saw a huge stingray right below our Villa and several turtles grazing in the sea meadow. Of course there are hundreds of different species of reef fish around the resort. We also saw a black tip shark cruising around the house reef. Highlight was watching some trevallies feeding off a school of baitfish right underneath the main deck.   Service: It is two things: genuine and polished. Everyone smiles and greets you as they pass by and the restaurant service is truly white glove. Everyone is extremely‚Ä¶
"My mother and I have travelled together to several exotic places including South Pacific and Indian Ocean. This was our first visit to the Maldives. We experienced 8 truly amazing days at Six Senses Laamu. Food was excellent and we especially liked the Leaf restaurant and the harvest of fresh greens that accompanied the different courses. All the staff was very welcoming. On our way back to Europe at Velana International airport the Six Senses staff person went out of his way to help us through a very slow queue for check-in, when we were worried to miss our flight. Hamzaht our gem was truly attentive to our needs and Ibrahim was meticulous in keeping our villa clean and neat. The warm water was a joy for swimming and snorkeling and Turtle beach which our villa was facing was‚Ä¶"
"If you thought pictures look good, just wait until you see it in person. The views were only to be topped by the incredible service, food and drinks. A great variety, with something for everyone.  We did the Saint & Sinners package, which we highly recommend. With the cost of drinks $18+ and all menu items north of $25+, extending to $65-$70, it‚Äôs simply more relaxing to have paid up front and not have to think about it every time you eat or drink.   Staying in an overwater bungalow is a must. There‚Äôs a premium option with a pool, but with direct access to the ocean and a pool at the resort, we opted for the one without a pool - it didn‚Äôt feel like you were missing anything.   They take no shoes, no shirt, no problems to heart - as no one on the island wears any shoes. You are‚Ä¶"
Hotel staffs were very professional. Rooms were very clean. Riding the bicycles around the island was very satisfying. Sad part was we had to stay for few days. Our Gem Aslah was very caring & help us to arrange everything we needed. Thank you for all the staffs
My wife and I spent Xmas and NY 2020/21 in Six Senses Laamu and declared it the best holiday of our life. Seeing as we have travelled the world extensively and are probably quite critical - declaring it our best holiday is high praise. Our expectations for our return to Laamu for Xmas/NY 2021/22 - this time bringing our 3 adult children and their partners were (too?) high and we feared that we might be disappointed. But the answer was no - Laamu was as delightful and wonderful as the first time and we (again) had the holiday of a lifetime. And it was great to see that so many of the Laamu team were still there to welcome us. The worlds best GM - Marteyne - welcomed us at the boat and our amazing GEM Aslah was there of course who fixes any problems promptly and is a far better at‚Ä¶
"Bare foot luxury at its best!! Insane Turquoise lagoon and white sandy beaches.  Wonderful eating experience and super friendly staff, but most of all a special mention to our amazing GEM Shah. Many thanx üòå"
Shah was a great host.. All staff were very helpful .  Excellent food and bar tenders very well trained. The chef behind the Indian Buffet was really nice and did a very good job Definitely we will be back with our family.
Well done for an incredibly beautiful experience in the  most idyllic surroundings supported by a team of genuinely caring staff. Special thanks to our GEM Shah for taking care of all our needs on a daily basis . You are a star. Well done to all the team and all the staff - you really have got it right!   Hope to see you all again soon.  JM Malta
A fantastic experience at Six senses Laamu . I recommend this place if you would like to be cut off the usual frantic everyday life . A perfect relaxation place . A special thanks goes to our GEM Shah who took very good care of us throughout the the whole holiday . Thank you Shah for making this experience unique!
"This is the most amazing vacation me and my wife ever had.  This place is a paradise with outstanding staff, so freindly and accommodating. We had the pleasure to have Shah as our GEM. He made our stay the best we ever experienced.  Thank you to all the lovely staff at Six Senses, Laamu! We will miss you all!"
"You  will experience something completely out of the ordinary! Everything, just everything is more than you could ever wish for in a vacation. We had the best host in Shah that made our vacation to the best ever ! The food was Amazing Even for me who is hard to please. There is something for everyone , every night! We had a dinner at the beach last night ‚Äù sunken table dinner‚Äù it was Amazing ."
"Our stay at the Six Senses was nothing short of magical. The resort itself is beautiful, the amenities are incredibly thoughtful, there are a number of dining options to explore, and so many activities to keep you entertained: daily snorkeling with a marine biologist, scuba diving in the remarkable coral reefs nearby, cooking classes, sunset cruises, movies under the stars, and a spa that could be a resort in its own right.  I‚Äôd be remiss, however, if I didn‚Äôt mention the staff. Not only is everyone so friendly and accommodating, but it is also so clear they are working very hard to make the guest experience as special as possible. Our GEM (personal concierge), Shah, was always a breath of fresh air, checking in with us twice daily and helping us tailor a schedule of activities‚Ä¶"
"Had a fantastic honeymoon at six senses. The attention to detail was apparent every step from arrival to departure. Just the right amount of coordination from our guest experience manager Shah who was everywhere you needed him and nowhere you didn‚Äôt. Great fun along the way with the all the marine biologists for snorkeling and educational talks, countless sea turtles, sharks, and rays during our scuba with Nik, a delicious cooking class with Dhilshaan, and expertly made cocktails and the seaside and poolside bars. Can‚Äôt wait to come back."
"10 years in the making, this trip was exactly what my husband and I expected. Every detail was taken care of. Our GEM (butler of sorts) assisted with all of wants and needs, checked in daily making sure our needs were being met. The spa was absolutely 5 star. I had several treatments but Vijaya Laxmi Goyal was amazing in her practice. She is a visiting practitioner until 14 February 2022. I‚Äôm so glad I was here to meet her and take in her services. If you are able take advantage of what she has to offer please do!  Thank you six senses, chefs, wait staff, housekeeping and all the staff behind the scenes. Amazing work everyone!"
"The best hotel in Maldivas paradise, with the best GEM Sthepnhay! Totaly vegan frindly,   They prepared special dishes for us who are a vegan couple. A more than special care. We will certainly be back.  There is no plastic on the island, there is a social and environmental concern, which captivated us."
"We spent such a magical week in paradise at Six Senses Laamu and could not have been happier with everything: its natural beauty, outstanding accommodations , fantastic food, lovely spa, and the most attentive service imaginable. Special thanks to our most amazing butler (gem) Abdulla who took such fantastic care of us at every step, always giving us the perfect balance of privacy and attention.  It was a long trip for us to get there from the US but the travel was absolutely well worth it.  Highest recommendation!"
"My husband and I spent 14 days (4-18 Jan 2022) at Six Senses Laamu.  We booked over-water villa 73 on Jetty C.  It had unobstructed views of the sunrise and horizon, and we could just jump into the sea and snorkel from the villa.   Upon arrival the Six Senses representative at the airport received us and upon arrival at the resort, representatives of the various functions welcomed us. The ratio of staff to guests is about 3 staff to 1 guest, therefore the attention to detail is immaculate. We were allocated our private ‚ÄúGEM‚Äù (Guest Experience Maker), Ainura, who was prompt in responding to all of our needs and recommended great suggestions for our anniversary celebration and my husband's birthday.     Our dedicated villa attendant, Suhan, was also very prompt in his service of‚Ä¶"
"My husband and I spent ten days in Six Senses Laamu last November for our honeymoon. We spent the first week in a Sunset Laamu Water Villa and upgraded ourselves to a Sunset Laamu Pool Villa for the last three days. Everything was on point - staff were warm and considerate, and went out of their way to make our stay as special and memorable as possible. One thing I want to applaud Six Senses Laamu for is their careful attention to food allergies - I have severe food allergies and our wonderful GM ensured that every restaurant was aware of my allergies and were able to accommodate them. We will for sure be back!"
All the personnel was very friendly and supportive. Especially our GEM Shah made our vacation unforgettable. He organized all of our activities und brought us in contact with other people from the island. The food in the different restaurants was first class. We liked most the ZEN.  Barbara and Karlheinz
"The nature and atmosphere of the island is unique. The location is a real fairy tale. Special thanks to our GEM Hassan for his outstanding service. We recommend delicious in-villa breakfasts, Japanese restaurant and a blissful SPA."
"I just couldn‚Äôt keep myself from saying how beautiful this place is. It is simply a paradise island. I came with my wife to celebrate her birthday & I am so happy I chose this place. The island is just so relaxing & the staff is unbelievably friendly. Perfect foods with varieties of options on different restaurants. Shout out to our Gem Aslah who gave attention to every detail that we could possibly need for. Thank you to all the wonderful staffs. It was not only an amazing trip, but we felt like we made some amazing friends too. Until next time."
"Currently sat in our Hotel room in Male waiting for our plane tomorrow Looking back on the most amazing 9 days. The resort is beautiful with plenty of character and charm that we just loved. Our room was a over water ocean villa which was extremely spacious with excellent charm, we didn‚Äôt miss having a pool what so ever as the Indian Ocean is like a warm Bath!  The food and service was fantastic, we tried all the restaurants giving plenty of variety and different charm and setting for each one.  Big thank you to our GEM Ath-Har who made our week run effortlessly and also to Warren who is one of the best mixologists I‚Äôve met and also the happiest friendliest most attentive guy. Thank you!

"Six Senses is for sure one of my favorite hotel chains, and Six Senses Laamu is amazing. There is not one bad thing to say about this hotel. The vibe is incredible, the staff are all super nice. Highlights from the hotel: out GEM Aslah is super great, he set everything up for us with no hitches! It was my birthday and he arranged a special welcome in the room with champagne and a cake!  We took a diving course and our teacher is incredibly nice and patient with us. Dotty is amazing!  Every single person who works in the hotel is very nice, shoutout to Mohamed who cleaned the rooms amazingly fast, sometimes we were away from the room for 30 minutes and when we came back it was already clean! And can‚Äôt forget the incredible ice cream bar , and the great woman who makes them!!"
"Wow! wow! Wow! From the seamless Six Senses transfer at Male to the connecting flight and speedboat to bring us to the resort, it was clear the attention to detail was top notch. My wife and I have been staying here for 8 nights and know the Six Senses product well from multiple trips to Zighy Bay. We love the understated luxury Six Senses stands for as well as the focus on sustainability. That‚Äôs why we chose Six Senses Laamu. Having read literally every trip advisor comment before booking, I had very high expectations but they have been more than met! Little things like the warm welcome on the jetty from the mangers, our GEM, the chef and the marine biologist before whisking us away to our Villa to unwind after the long journey; the fact that seemingly every loo has a glass‚Ä¶"
"We just returned from paradise on earth. We had the absolute pleasure of staying at the Six Senses resort in the Maldives and it was without doubt one of the best holidays we have ever had. (And I am from Australia, where we have plenty of picture perfect places to visit).  We are a family of four, two kids, aged 14 & 10 and we could not have chosen a better place in the Maldives to stay. There was so much for our kids to do, that they do not ask to use technology,  which was one of our objectives. They spent the whole day outside enjoying all the wonderful things the resort had to offer.   Our son was up early learning to surf in the mornings and learning how to scuba dive in the afternoons. Our daughter also learnt how to scuba dive and loved it.   The abundance of marine life‚Ä¶"
"Our 4th trip to Six Senses Laamu - this time for New Year - and it is quite as magical as ever.   From our daily private speedboat adventures exploring the far reaches and best reefs of the atoll with Yameen our boat captain and drone catcher extraordinaire and Ali our brilliant marine biologist - to a NYE Gala Dinner that was a triumph for the F&B team - and amazing treatments with visiting practitioner Rangith as well as Bonita at the spa - everything here was perfect.   Of course none of this would be possible without our fantastic, funny and efficient and generally brilliant GEM Abdulla and the leadership and constant presence of GM Marteyne as well as all the wonderful staff here.  Special shout out to Abi the ice cream guru who presides over 48 complimentary flavours‚Ä¶"
"I loved the resort so much! It is so beautiful, the food is amazing and the service is even better. Special thanks to Stephany who helped us perfectly during our stay and made sure we had the best time! Thank you so much"
We have just left the six senses in Laamu and had simply the best time. The website doesn‚Äôt advertise well enough how good this resort is for families (especially with young kids) but it really is one of the best we have been to (and we‚Äôve spent time at other fantastic 5 star resorts). Our kids (6 and 7yrs old) absolutely loved the kids club and have never before asked to go to kids club every day (we normally have to persuade them) and the kids club was so interesting and varied with a healthy mix of water sports. A special shout out to the team there. The food is exceptional and every night it felt like we were dining in Michelin starred restaurants especially leaf and zen. The buffets are extraordinary and plentiful. The New Year‚Äôs Eve gala dinner was something else- I felt I‚Ä¶
"We just finished our third visit to Six Senses. We didn't know what might've changed since our last visit in early 2020, and I'm so happy to say that it just keeps getting better. The reef is still in fantastic shape thanks to the efforts of the staff biologists (and of course the support from the hotel), and all things we've come to love about the resort are still there, as good or better than ever. The dive team, the surf team, the ocean activities team, all the kids' services and the attention to even the smallest detail, it's all amazing. Yet again we really feel this is by far the best resort in all the Maldives. When we left, our daughter said ""this is my favorite hotel in the whole world.""  I also want to say the staff here is truly next-level (the Longitude team in‚Ä¶"
We had a great time over New Year at this marvellous place. Fantastic snorkeling close the resort - first dive we saw 4 turtles :). The food was excellent and our GEM Ahmed made our stay easy and relaxing. Thanks for all your help. Hope to back one day.
"We had such a great stay at Six Senses Laamu, from beginning to end! Even if the trip to come here is long, it is certainly worth it. The food is great and the staff are all very friendly and there to help out with whatever you may need. Special thanks to our fantastic GEM Shah, who took care of our every needs. Also thanks to all the waiting staff- especially Adam (amongst other things for helping us to spot  dolphins) and Raif. We will definitely come back!"
"An incredible place with even more incredible staff. 10/10  from beginning to end. I have been to the Maldives 3 times before. I always loved it, but Six Senses brings the experience to another level. The place is gorgeous, the food is great, and the staff really delivers on everything. From breakfast service to the poolbar Sip Sip, the restaurants for dinner, chefs, housekeeping, and last but not least our personal gem Ainura. If you dont have a good time in Six Senses you wont have a good time anywhere!!! A special Thanks to Raaif and Naail, Ainura and Warren! Along with the rest of the staff you guys really made our trip!!   This group really did their best to make our stay exactly as we wanted it to be and they succeeded.

Our GEM Sephany (who my kids talk about every day) had already arranged some great experinces for us, and together we added even more. Our favorite dining experiences were the ones with the live cooking stations. We did mediteranian, south aisian and christmas diners and had a favorite dish every time. I had the best Beef Wellington of my entire life.  Kids club was amazing! My kids woke up every day wanting to know what were the activities. They were all super educatinal and fun.

"Truly beautiful resort island offering everything you expect from a luxurious 5* hotel at Maldives. We had a lively time and would not hesitate to come back on our next trip. Special thanks to our Gem Aslah who seems to care very much about guests & a true example of what it means to go extra mile to make us comfortable. Last but not the least, food was beyond delicious, true gourmet paradise."
"My parents & i stayed at six senses laamu for a week and had a blissful holiday of our dreams. Staffs are the greatest asset of the resort always smiling and helpful. We tried all the restaurants and also preferred sand bank. Food was delicious in all the places. My parents were been well look after & felt very much pampered by our Gem Aslah, who was always helpful when ever they need help. We highly recommend this place enough. Kudos & keep up the great work."
"I had stayed for two weeks at Six Senses Laamu in a Water Villa with private pool (#44, right at the end of jetty B) and must say that my stay was exceeding my high expectations in all aspects.   The resort is located on a small island and offered plenty of activities throughout my stay. I participated in Dolphin cruises, fishing trips and snorkeling excursions which were perfectly organized. One of the highlights of my stay was certainly the one day stay on a private island which was simply stunning. Also, the sustainability manager provided me an impressive tour of the island including the garden, water treatment etc.   All facilities of the resort are extremely clean and the water villa has a spectacular view over the lagoon and crystal clear waters. It is equipped with‚Ä¶"
Amazing property with the most friendly staffs. Special thanks to Gem Aslah for taking such a great care of us. Highly recommend going here as this was our second trip to the Maldives & was a far better experience than the previous hotel we stayed at (not naming it but it is considered amongst the best properties in Maldives too). Great food & overall a superb experience for couples & families as well.
"My family was lucky enough to spend our outstanding holidays and my birthday at Six Senses Laamu and the experience was truly exceptional! Apologies for not writing the review right after the departure but our emotions after unforgettable experience are fresh! The atmosphere is magnificent, thoughtfully designed to plunge into the natural landscape and provided some of the most spectacular views we had seen in Maldives. Wandering all over the area barefooted, cycling and merely view gazing - everything is amazing! The staff at Six Senses Laamu fairly became our second family, the level of service is unmatched and the personal touches were thoughtful and made us feel truly special.

Our Guest Experience Maker Shah was only on hand to provide support with bookings for activities or restaurants, ensuring that our holiday ran smoothly and we wanted for nothing, the rest of the staff were equally excellent, with shout outs to Chef Ishmael who gave us some lessons in Maldivian cooking, Chef Ihaka who demonstrated a masterclass in cooking with chilli, and a massive thank you to Keshan and Leevan who went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. Everyone there worked incredibly hard and had real pride in‚Ä¶"
"From the Junior Marine Biology Program to the dedicated dive centre and daily sustainability tours along with organic gardens and on-island water production, recycling of all materials (glass, cardboard, coconuts etc..)  and countless other initiatives to pioneer a more planet friendly approach to Maldives living the Six Senses is truly trail blazing in it's approach - aiming for a completely plastic free resort by 2023 (no small feat).  Our kids had not only a brilliant time full of actives they also had their minds opened to ocean life and what we all need to urgently do to protect them.  Our GEM Aslah was truly awesome and we nothing was too much trouble leaving us with truly reconnecting experience with no frictions.  All our six senses were enlivened and we left healthier,‚Ä¶"
"It truly is a slice of heaven/reprieve from the covid madness. People are very hospitable. I have two kids who bicycled around the island carefree. Kids club has lots of fun activities. The snorkeling is truly amazing clear waters. Its quite secluded. Most importantly, it gave our family the mental reset we needed. Special shout out to our Gem Aslah who went above & beyond to make sure we had a pleasant stay. We plan to do this vacation annually. Highly recommend to anyone!"
The beauty of the place & the island is a thing of imagination. The staffs are very friendly. We love the butler service which made things flawless. our Gem Aslah was very respectful & corporate & answers all the questions confidently. In short he is a great employee. Even the Shifam who took care of the villa was very lovely. A special island surrounded by a singular beautiful nature.
"We had such a great time on six senses laamu, super friendly staffs & excellent foods. We went to snorkeling twice every day at the house reef. Saw many turtles & sharks. This was exactly what we were looking for. Put your shoes off & relax. We hope to be back one day. Special thanks to our Gem Aslah for making our stay perfect & unforgettable ‚ù§Ô∏è See you all!"
This resort is excellent & my family & I would through recommend this beautiful island. All staff were so friendly & couldn't be enough to make definitely feel more welcome. Special thanks to our Gem Aslah who was helpful always. The food was amazing & we will definitely be returning. If I had to rate this amazing place I would give it 10 stars.
"We had an incredible week at Laamu where we stayed in a beautiful overwater villa.  Our stay was almost flawless - the staff were phenomenal and the attention to detail world-class.   Highlights of the stay were Vicky and her amazing team at the Den (Kids Club) where she Hasna, Abi and Zahee looked after our children so brilliantly that our girls asked to go back to Kids club every evening and first thing every morning! When we left we were given the most gorgeous book of memories from their time at the Den and the book that they all read together every day - such a special gift.  Lawrence who heads up F+B is a superstar - completely on it, he sees EVERYTHING and makes you feel like you're home rather than a guest. The food is delicious - the buffets were astonishing and I am‚Ä¶"
"This is the place if you like to see wonders when snorkelling just next to your room, eat excellent and diverse foods and enjoy best-in-class service. Special kudos to Aslah our GM as well as Saalim for room keeping."
"As you can see, I've been to many world top class resort in Maldives-Gili Lanksnfush, Conrad, Anantara and so on. Now, after spending my holiday in Laamu, I think Laamu is the best resort in Maldives. First of all It's hard to have both lagoon and underwater environment. But Laamu has both. Under water, without scuba diving, you can see so many fish in coral, turtles and sharks and when you lie in your bed, you can see the vast-transparent-turquoise lagoon. Secondly Cost -effectiveness is quite high. Thirdly you can be Robinson Crusoe in luxuary resort. I'm so sorry this resort is not photogenic. But after you visit here, you will be surprised how luxuary and eco-friendly this resort is. Finally, Every staff is so kind and thoughtful. I want to say Thank you to Alex and Shark‚Ä¶"
"We have just finished a tremendous holiday at Six Senses Laamu. The food was brilliant, the staff couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful, the kids club was fantastic and the resort is truly beautiful. Our GEM Aslah made our stay very special and organised everything for us. We can‚Äôt wait to come back again."
"√ñne of the best resorts ever stayed. Beautiful & amazing views. Friendly staff. Delicious food. Calm & relaxing ambiience. Great snorkeling. We thank to all six senses staffs specially our Gem Aslah, We hope to visit this beautiful island again soon."
"Just returned from the short vacation, six senses laamu can be considered peace of heaven on the earth. Wonderful weather,nice distribution of water villas. Lovely staffs starting from the airport until you leave from the island. Always smiling & ready to help. Special thanks to our Gem Aslah who was amazing during our stay. Quickly answer all inquiries & does the magic. Variety of food choices. Will hopefully return soon"
"We have just returned from 2 weeks at six senses Maldives and we are feeling totally relaxed and refreshed . The resort itself is situated on a beautiful island with incredible far reaching views of the ocean. We hadn‚Äôt appreciated before booking that the hotel has a sizeable coral reef attached to it, which meant we had extremely good snorkelling at our finger tips (we went every day and saw so much). We knew the resort would be a perfect honeymoon destination but we were incredibly impressed with how good the resort was at catering to our young baby and associated needs . The flexibility and relaxed atmosphere helped us as a family feel very comfortable.   What makes the resort even more special are the staff and we absolutely loved getting to know everyone ! We had an‚Ä¶"
"We are used to go luxury hotels and to be honest we had some doubts before coming SIx Senses Laamu as we were used to go other hotel chain all previous years.  I‚Äôll start and say that the place is amazing from all aspects:Beaches, Vila, food. Activities , and on top of all the service ! From the point of making reservation till the checkout it was top service . 0 mistakes and no complaints from my side (really rare) . The place is worth every dollar . Hurry up and book a room for 2022."
"We are world travelers and recently had one of the most pleasurable vacations of our lifetimes at Six Senses Laamu. We stayed in an overwater sunset villa with pool. The villa was stupendous in all regards. Other than snorkeling and eating, it was very hard for us to ever leave the villa. The service is second to none! The atmosphere is so relaxed that if you arrive with stress, I cannot imagine it staying with you. This is a bucket-list place to go. We traveled to several other Maldives resorts but Six Senses Maldives was in a class of its‚Äô own."
"Absolute paradise and it was such a special stay - thanks to the whole team for the wonderful stay and looking after us!  - Shah for organising, Kavish and Maduka for drinks, Hassan at sip sip and our Chili Table friend (who we didn't catch his name). We look forward to coming back in the future :)"
"Thanks to the whole team for a lovely stay - Shah for organising, Kavish and Maduka for drinks, Hassan at sip sip and our Chili Table friend (who we didn't catch his name). We look forward to coming back at some point."
"Everything about the resort is incredible!  From the food to the spa, the rooms, the snorkeling and most of all the staff, it was all amazing.  The moment we stepped out of arrivals in Male we were looked after by Ahmed and whisked off to the lounge.  It was such a nice touch to feel like we were being taken care of as soon as we arrived.  That feeling just continued, from the boat ride across to the island and meeting our GEM, the amazing Thorir, we were looked after.  This was my first Six Senses and the GEM experience was new to me.  Thorir was simply amazing - really friendly, funny and superbly efficient too.  It was always a pleasure chatting at breakfast as he shared so much about life at the resort and in the islands that was interesting and funny.  Thorir really made‚Ä¶"
"My husband and I spent a week here as part of our honeymoon in November 2021. It was the most spectacular vacation we have ever had. Six Senses is a company we will be loyal to for years to come. Their dedication to the best visitor experience, sustainability, and community support is unparalleled.   The room. It's hard to put into words! What you've seen in magazines springs to life in these bungalows. We stayed in a overwater villa on Jetty C. It was extremely private which was amazing. The water is like a pool - so warm and clear. Just standing on the deck I saw so many fish, a sea turtle, and a reef shark. It was amazing. Our room attendant, Shifam and his team were incredible. Each morning they made the room light up and feel fresh, and each evening the popped in to make‚Ä¶"
"Dear Six senses Laamu Team,  Thank you so much for everything and Making us feel at Home and very Welcome. Special thanks to Shah who helped us Always when needed and helped us to keep private. We'll come again!!! Gabi & Reinhard Urban"
"Amazing Resort, as always six senses has the best services! The island of Laamu is speechless, the people working here are so nice, friendly, helpful, the activities are so interesting and all are well done, till details. Frankly we are thinking about booking the next year already... Would be difficult to give special thanks to anyone, as everyone is fantastic... but special thanks to Sha, Shaania, Hafiz and everybody we have met there."
We had the best holidays in the world with the greatwst team. Thank you so much Shah and Shania and Hafiz and Abi and all guys around for making our holidays the best!!!! Wonderful time and the best relax
"This is a must go resort in the Maldives! The service, the rooms, the restaurants everything was above our expectations we will certainly come back. Ashla was our GEM he was fantastic!! We brought our 7m old baby staff were very helpful with that even arranged babysitting."
"We came to Six senses recommended by friends and the resort exceeded our expectations. It is one of the few luxury hotels we have been to that is truly worth the price. The food is excellent, the resort has many activities which was a nice surprise, diving was one of the best, we saw mantas and plenty of sharks and turtles, there is even surf every day!  The snorkeling in front of the rooms is also great. The rooms over the water are incredible and cleverly made so you have privacy despite having other rooms just next to you. We brought our 7m old baby and staff were very nice to her and accommodating. They assign you a staff (called GEM) who takes care of your entire stay and organises all experiences for you ahead of your arrival and during your stay - ours was brilliant try‚Ä¶"
"The hospitality was amazing, The daily acitivities were great.  Snorkling here was spetacular! We Will always remember this trip. Also, an incredible work from our GEM, abdullah, always very dedicated, organized our week fantastically."
"Just left a perfect honeymoon week at Six Senses Laamu. Not only are the facilities, villas and food absolutely outstanding as you would expect from a 5 star hotel - it is the people who make this place truly special. Our Gem (Guest Experience Maker) called Shah was outstanding, he was diligent, kind, immediately responsive and went over and above to make sure we were happy. When we found out the Evening BBQ on the sandbank was fully booked for our stay Shah organised one for us on the evening that they usually don‚Äôt offer it so that we didn‚Äôt miss out on the experience - cue cocktails watching sunset followed by a four course meal which would rival any top london Restaraunt - all cooked on a bbq on a sandbank 2km from land. It was mindblowing.  From the moment you arrive here,‚Ä¶"
"My husband and I had a fantastic week at six senses for the first week of our honeymoon. The staff are a highlight with every member providing a smile and greeting when passing, it makes you feel welcome immediately. Our GEM Shah was on hand all week, always communicating with a smile and wanting to help in any way possible, we couldn‚Äôt have been in better hands.  A highlight for us was seeing a shark, turtle and sting ray within 30 seconds of dipping off of our water villa - truly magical. We also had a surfing lesson and went on the dolphin sunset cruise where we were lucky enough to see some Dolphins and hear some great knowledge from out guide.  If you have the time I also suggest the sandbank sunset cocktails and bbq- it was unreal and the host Anime and chef Ismail greeted‚Ä¶"
"We arrived at Six Senses in early December 2021 for 8 nights and the resort is incredible.  The staff is friendly and attentive, the food is excellent, the snorkeling is amazing, and there is plenty to do for a full week.   The water villas are a must stay and they will impress you.   The water is crystal clear and warm.   Six Senses offers plenty of water sports and excursions to satisfy your needs.   They also have a very impressive spa that I highly recommend.   Overall we had a terrific experience and will recommend this resort to all of my friends and family.  A special thanks to Ainura who was our guest experience maker at the resort as she did a wonderful job of creating a memorable experience."
We came to Laamu Six Senses for our belated honeymoon (due to Covid!) and it was 100% worth the wait. We had the most wonderful GEM called Shah who honestly went above and beyond with everything he did. He‚Äôs such an uplifting person who cared about making sure we were having the best experience at all times. I feel we were so lucky to have had him as he really made the difference for us and we so enjoyed seeing him every each day. Shah we wish you all the best and want to say a huge THANK YOU. You‚Äôre a star!
We had the most incredible stay with Six Senses in Laamu which was made even better by the exceptional Shah. Nothing was too much trouble and he always had the biggest smile on his face. He‚Äôs the happiest person who clearly loves his job. He dealt with any query we had immediately and went the extra mile with certain requests we had which we so appreciated. We honestly couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better GEM and want to say a huge thank you and that we hope he gets recognised for all his efforts by Six Senses and in the future as he was just absolutely brilliant in every way.
"This is truly the best hotel we‚Äôve ever been! Waiting 5h in Male for connection flight followed by a ride on a speed board (quite bumpy!) - you forget about all this travel madness a minute after you‚Äôre finally there. We‚Äôve been to many luxury hotels around the world, but  nothin can compete with Six Senses Laamu.  We‚Äôve travel with 2 year old toddler, and I can say this this place is super child friendly. Service is outstanding- I couldn‚Äôt imagine a better one. Butlers are always there for you, they come to your table  for  a quick catch up chat. What is more, you always see a Hotel Manager chatting with guests, I think it‚Äôs very important (Patrick, if you‚Äôre reading this, thank you very much for what you‚Äôre doing).  Waiters mention all the small details: for example, I‚Äôve been‚Ä¶"
"Magical experience, great place highly recommended. They take care of every detail.  Food, housing they make life easier for you and let you do what you come here for, to relax and have a great time in paradise.  I would come back and would recommend it."
"Go here  and ask to have Shah as your personal GEM. He is amazing and the most beautiful person. He makes the entire holiday a delight.   Lawrence the Food and Beverage manager was also outstanding and was very open to suggestions and enhancements.  The dive centre is brilliant - JJ, Jazz and Danny are all brilliant ‚Ä¶ They are all knowledgable and safety first.  Food excellent Accommodation outstanding Dolphins a brilliant surprise Diving great Staff a pleasure  The only criticism would be the travel and lack of a private lounge en route.   Kinda reluctant to say how good this place is as don‚Äôt want everyone going and spoiling it.  Thank you team six senses  Xxx"
Loved every minute - a relaxed holiday destination is a real art - so much planning and attention to detail is required - Six Senses Laamu hits all the right spots! The Guest Experience Manager is such a great concept and ensures you receive tailored and continuity of care - ask for Abdulla - just the best!
"Wow, where do I start? The Six Senses Maldives was the most incredible stay we have ever had at a hotel, from the reservation, to the welcome, throughout the stay and the departure. This hotel has everything right!  From taking our shoes off upon arrival at the private transfer boat and never seeing them again until we left was the best way to start our get away. As we arrived at the resort we were greeted by our Guest Experience Maker, Shah, who is probably the most incredible human I have ever met. Shah goes above and beyond to make everyone‚Äôs stay an incredible experience, stopping in every morning during breakfast to ask if there is ANYTHING he can do to make your stay better.  Upon our arrival he had already made dinner reservations for us, organized some activities and‚Ä¶"
This was our first visit to the Maldives & we did our homework before deciding to choose the resort to stay. The island did not disappoint us & it was stunning. Several restaurants & foods were excellent. staffs were wonderful & friendly & always there to help. special thanks to our Gem Aslah who was very helpful.  Just a very relaxing & chilled island that anyone would want to come over & over again.
"We're longtime fans of the Six Senses brand, having been exclusively staying at a SS resort properties for the past decade in places like Thailand, Bali, Vietnam, Fiji and even already have a reservation at the Six Senses  Zil Pasyon for next year! Why do I say all this?  Because I want preface my review by saying that any areas of improvement feedback I give here are intended as a way to help SS Laamu improve.   First the positives: - I love the culture of being barefoot on the entire island. The only time I wore footwear was during my morning sunrise runs around the island. They of course make this possible by making sure all the grounds, the jetties and piers are clean of anything that might hurt the feet. Huge kudos to the grounds staff! This barefoot culture fits in with‚Ä¶"
"Stayed for 8 nights. Had great time, food, activities and would definitely revisit. Shah, GEM, ensured everything went well, breakfast restaurant servers were attentive and ice cream lady was friendly."
"It took us a long time to get to the resort from S. KOREA....  but once we arrived at the resort, we forgot how long it took, how tired we were.  The island and the resort was amazing and whole environment was too good to be true...  we spent 4 lovely days and all the activity(mostly snorkeling, sunset dolphin cruse, massage spa, enjoying the view of island) was very much satisfactory.  Not to mention the kindness and support of all the sixsenses staff. Always welcome you with smile.  Especially, I had a hard time to do snorkeling.. but the instructor keep looking after and gave an advice  for me so eventually I could get to meet under-the-sea world and very much enjoyed.  Also, our GEM, Ainura, was always there to take care of us so we just do nothing but enjoy our time in the‚Ä¶"
"Fantastic resort in Maldives. Everything was perfect. The premisses are amazing, the villas are extremely comfortable and the food and drinks are all delicious. Also, the staff is very kind and always professional. There is really nothing of negative to say. We also recommend diving with the Blue Deep Divers dive center. Great staff, very good equipment and unforgettable encounters with the Mantas.  A huge thanks to our GEM (and friend) Shihan, who was the main responsible for making our trip so special."
"We have visited Six Senses Laamu for our honeymoon and we are so happy we got to celebrate it here. From the moment we got to the airport the Six senses staff looked after us making our journey seamless.  We got introduced to Shihan as soon as we got to the resort and he has been absolutely incredible, letting us know of all the daily activity‚Äôs, organising our dinners for us, booking our pcr test and being on hand 24/7 with anything we need.   The overwater lagoon villa is total paradise and it‚Äôs always exciting spotting different sea creatures both in the water and from the villa.  The food here is out of this world and all the staff are so friendly and helpful.  We can‚Äôt wait to come back to this resort in the future,"
"Super relaxing and luxurious, they really have thought of everything. Shah, our GEM, did everything he possibly could to make our stay enjoyable and fun. You can chose to be completely private or more social at Sip Sip, however to spend your time it is perfect. Snorkelling and dicing really good. Quality and variety of food great. Room service, staff and free ice cream all great!"
"We were looking for extreme luxury, privacy and relation and SS Laamu over delivered on everything. The service, the villa, the attention to detail, the food, the drinks, the scenery and above all else our GEM, Shah. The entire stay was beautiful, fun and so, so luxurious."
"I always knew the Maldives would be a special place.  The Six Senses Laamu literally exceeded our expectations.  We‚Äôve traveled a lot and have seen a lot.  And though the travel itself was long (but certainly doable thanks to business class), it was well worth the trip.  From the staff welcome to the impeccable food, everything was perfect!    We have a specific diet  with some restrictions (non dairy, different allergies and one vegan) and the food staff did not disappoint.  On point with the high quality food selection and the taste was delicious!  And we did a birthday dinner on the sandbank at sunset.  Amazing views and hands down the absolute BEST meal of the week.  [Please send screw pine lobster bisque soup to the US ASAP!] Highly recommend the sandbank dining for a‚Ä¶"
"Heaven an earth. Service beyond all expectations. Excellent food. Down to earth luxury. Reefs in fairly good condition. Great gym. Wonderful staff. Can only recommend   Great for families and couples. Loved the idea of no plastic on the island, focus on re-cycle, sustainable travel and marine biology."
"We visited from November 26 to December 4th, 2021. We were met at the airport by SixSenses staff, and right we felt we chose the right place to have our vacation. They made our arrival and transfer to the resort not only smooth and seamless but also enjoyable. At the resort we experienced no less. Staff took care of us like a family. Our manager Nura was amazing snd super caring for our 9-year old son. She made sure we are having the best out of our visit. The food was delicious, fresh and full of flavor from the island. We stayed at the sea side villa. Very nice, quit and relaxing. The kids club had so many activities for our son and he really had fun and made several new friends. The class supervisors were so nice, knowledgeable, and passionate about kids experiences. The‚Ä¶"
"It was the perfect honeymoon destination which certainly lives up to its expectations! From the moment we arrived at Male airport with the staff helping with our luggage, till we got on the boat and given bags to put our shoes in, to the moment we arrived on the island and greeted and introduced to everyone was absolutely perfect. The level of service the staff at Six Senses Laamu provide is absolutely amazing!   The island is absolutely stunning and nothing was ever too much for our amazing GEM Shifu. She was always available at the other end of the phone and helped us coordinate all our excursions and meals from the day we arrived. She ensured we were kept up to date with whatever was available each day and even rang us in the early hours of the morning to inform us the turtle‚Ä¶"
"I arrived to Six Senses Laamu, With high hopes. I Should say that the Service level was beyond what I have ever imagined in a hotel. The food quality and the amazingly delicious drinks made everything just perfect. Once you arrive to the hotel you get a Dedicated personal. I got the best person SHIHAN, he made me eat in different restaurants, always available with a big smile. He and my girlfriend surprise me.   Japanese restaurant and Chill Bar is best.   Spa team good, I love the Steam room.   Thank Shihan and everyone.   I come back soon"
"We had a great time. the service was excellent, especially the friendliness of the employees, the hotel and the room with many details of comfort and good taste. Excelent food. The views of the place are beautiful, the fish and marine animals can be seen easily from your room and snorkeling nearby de hotel.   My family and I had the best time ever. Excelent Food, excelent service and 100% EcoFriendly."
"It was a perfect honeymoon in the most perfect place. The hotel is very pretty and the food is excellent. The best hospitality. Our GEM, Hamzath, is amazing and made our stay even more magical. It was a seven days dream.  Thank you for everything."
Near perfect resort. A very rewarding and unique experience. The breakfast is awesome and the crew make everything to make you satisfied. The island is stunning and the food is very good. Already left and cant wait to come back again. Liked a lot!
"This was our second visit to the Six Senses this year, this time we took our children. Once again we were blown away by the staff. Their professionalism, attitude and character would be hard to match elsewhere. A special mention to Aslah our GEM, where nothing was too much trouble. He delivered promptly, didn‚Äôt forget a thing and was generally  fantastic.  Adam, who took us on the sustainability tour was knowledgeable and enthusiastic. The kids loved this activity as did I and it gave us a real sense that the resort cares about its impact locally and globally. They are taking genuine steps  to reduce their carbon footprint and work with the locals. I can highly recommend doing this.  Vicky, Zahee and Hasna in the kids club were phenomenal. My kids are 11 and 13 so my expectation‚Ä¶"
"AMAZING!  The food, the spa, the villas, the service are excellent. My daughter (5 YO)  loved all the activities at the kids club, the free yummy ice-cream , seeing baby green turtles on the beach, the lessons with marine biologists and the cinema under the stars. My husband and I were able to go diving together and the diving was great: we encountered mantas, dolphins, eagle rays  and several sharks including a young tiger shark, and lots more in a few dives.  The resort takes sustainability and marine conservation very seriously and work closely with the local community. Plus there is a great team of marine biologists working on conservation projects and happy to share their knowledge with guests. Incredible experience!"
"The best hotel in Maldives. We are really in love with this wonderful hotel & perfect service, we felt like in paradise.  Our wonderful Gem Aslah made our special memorable. HE made each second like a dream for us. Thank you so much. We will hopefully come back with a baby !"
"The hotel structure is the best I‚Äôve ever seen!!! The service and the staff are wonderful and extremely careful and attentive!!! Special thanks to Niyaz and the best japanese food I‚Äôve ever eaten!! Special thanks to Abidha and her extreme sympathy!! Special thanks to Aslah, who is the best GEM (Guest Experience Manager)! Extremely patient and kind!! Everything were perfect and I‚Äôll definitely come back!"
"Everything was more than perfect, starting with the best GEM Aslah, which made the whole experience memorable, to Abidha, the sweetest girl that served us the best ice cream and Niyaz, who prepared a dream 30th bday dinner. The whole staff was flawless and we cant wait to come back!!"
"We spent one week on this marvellous island, the island is incredibly beautiful & the property is very well maintained. Beaches & ocean spot divine!  The service was very prompt & professional. Special thanks to our GEM Aslah who was very helpful during our stay.  We could not learn how to snorkel:)"
"Great resort especially for family and couples, honeymooners. Service is at its best, special thanks to Aslah, Adam, Yaani and Pema. Resort is special and sustainable. Amazing food and all the stuff are very friendly and professional. Really is heaven on earth."
"Your review:   I knew it would be beautiful but this trip exceeded my expectations.    Six Senses Laamu is a stunning resort with everything you could ask for.   The activities were fun and we were not short on options. We really enjoyed the Dolphin sunset cruise, water sports, and complimentary snorkelling trips. I also loved the fact Six Senses clearly respects the environment and minimises its impact (for example by preserving the long grass around the villas). Special thanks to Afaaz, Pip and Greg from the MUI team for running informative and fun sessions. They clearly love what they do. I managed to swim with green sea turtles, hawksbill turtles, black tip reef sharks, eagle rays, sting rays and numerous other amazing sea life.   The food at Six Senses was always amazing‚Ä¶"
"We couldn‚Äôt rave enough about our stay at Six Senses Laamu. From the minute we got off the boat (sans shoes!) and met our wonderful Guest Experience Maker (GEM), Shah, our experience has been second to none. The vistas and sunsets are stunning and the marine life just incredible. What really made it for us was the amazing hospitality from every member of the Six Senses team.  The food was delicious and every restaurant had the loveliest staff I‚Äôve ever met: so attentive and genuine.   Shah, our GEM, was one of the friendliest people we‚Äôve ever met and always willing to help - whether it be restaurant bookings or activities.   What a faultless service, I would give 6 stars if I could."
I went to Six Senses Laamu for our honey moon and our time there was perfect! The best hotel that I have been. My time there was perfect due to the services provided by my GEM Shihan. He took care of everything so I can have a full experience that the hotel can provide for you! If you go to Six Senses Laamu look for Shihan that he can help you to relax and have a great time!
"Couldn't recommend this place enough the staff were all lovely, especially our GEM Aslah who really looked after us & made our stay so much fun. Loved the foods in all the restaurants & waking up every day to the incredible sea view. Some amazing memories made."
"It‚Äôs our 3rd time in SS Laamu having stayed in all 3 comparable ‚Äúno news no shoes‚Äù high luxury resorts in the Maldives SF and GL as a family of 6 since 2016, as well as the ‚Äúyounger‚Äù HF for couples some years ago.    Hands off the SS ticks ALL the right boxes in a way the others can‚Äôt (and won‚Äôt for geographic, space, nature constraints)  and we tried everything on offer with our group aged 8-70 years old.   The one detail that is the weak spot  - the length of time to arrive there  - is then amply compensated by a full week (or more if you are lucky) not seeing Male building construction or hearing constant flights over our heads as you do in those peer resorts. The actual beach (I.e. sand) extension is also vastly superior in SS to any of the other four resorts, crucial if‚Ä¶"
"My husband and I  rarely return to the same location - we both agreed we simply must return here!   The beauty of the Maldives was elevated by our experience here. We were encouraged to go barefoot and it helped us feel connected to the earth.  They emphasize sustainability, and is nestled within nature left it as undisturbed as possible; be sure to take the Sustainability tour!  We stayed in one of the overwater villas - loved  stepping off our deck directly into the ocean to snorkel where the waters are teeming with beautiful marine life.  We even had an eagle ray one morning circling the waters around our villa.  All the food was exquisite.  We did the Lobster BBQ, where I had lobster prepared at least 5 ways; highly recommended.  Leaf was in a class of it's own. The menu‚Ä¶"
"What to say ‚Ä¶ other than if paradise exists, it‚Äôs called Six Senses Laamu. Accommodations are fantastic. We had a Water Villa with Pool and changed after for an Ocean Beach Villa with Pool. All the accommodations are designed to be perfectly integrated to nature. It‚Äôs 5 stars luxury hotel but Ecology is part of the priority and it‚Äôs greatly appreciated. The food quality is perfect. Special mention to Leaf Restaurant and Zen. Our Gem ‚Äúshah‚Äù made our stay to be perfect at all the time. Booking of restaurants‚Ä¶ advices. It‚Äôs sometimes embarrassing to be so will treated. Ask for Shah when coming here. He is also an amazing photographer.  Also the Diving School is phenomenal. I had Elena Cienfuegos as a teacher. This is a high level education teaching. She is so smart, sweet and knows‚Ä¶"
"From the moment you step on the island, the Six Senses team is working to ensure you have a once in a lifetime trip. From the helpful GEMs helping you plan each day perfectly, attentive food staff that are serving exquisite cuisine, and the Sip Sip pool bar team making sure you always have a cold drink in hand - everyone on the island is very friendly and accommodating. They make you feel comfortable so that you can fully turn your brain off for vacation mode!"
"Six senses is nothing short of a 5 star hotel with luxurious accommodations, excellent employees who treat you like family, fresh and delicious cuisine and the most beautiful water and beaches. Each guest gets a dedicated GEM (guest experience manager) and Aslah made our entire stay! Highly recommend for any couple looking for a romantic, relaxing and unforgettable getaway. Well be back!!!"
"I had my first stay in the Maldives in six senses laamu & I felt like in paradise. All the lovely staffs in restaurants & bars made the stay so perfect. Special to mention our Gem Aslah. Food was excellent in all the restaurants, a lovely beach,just barefoot at all the time. We loved it."
"Six Senses Laamu is The most wonderful experience. Imagine the perfect crossing of summer camp and luxury resort. Barefoot, divine beaches, crystal clear water, outstanding food and the best Dry Martini in the Universe, made by Head bartender Kavish.  Host Shah contributed to making it all a truly unforgettable experience."
"My husband and I stayed at Six Senses Laamu 10 days for our honeymoon (mid november).  Everything was perfect, from the moment someone from the staff waited for us at the airport in Mal√© when we arrived until the very end when they help us check in when we left. I cannot stress enough how great our stay was.  - The staff at Six Senses was perfect, from our amazing GEM Aslah, our villa attendant Saudhoon to ALL the staff at restaurants Leaf, Zen, Longitude, Chill Bar, Sip Sip and the nicest ice cream lady. Amazing choice of restaurants and the food was always delicious and perfectly cooked with local ingredients and fresh food. - the activities available were numerous. We did a sunset cruise to see the dolphins (it was awesomeee), fishing at sunrise (the boat crew was very nice‚Ä¶"
"Amazing place, great dives and natural life, incredible food and drinks. Villas over the water are a dream come true, with turtles swimming all around. Lots of fun stuff to do and boat rides you cannot miss (especially the dolphin sunset cruise). And, above all, the staff here makes you feel special and do go all the way so you have a unforgettable experience ‚Äî particularly the smiley waiters and the expert marine biologist team. If you decide to go, ask for Shah to be your GEM (guest experience maker) and be prepared to feel in heaven."
"After two years of pandemic we decided Maldives were a safe port to travel and Six Senses was always a first choice for all the fantastic experiences we‚Äôve had around the world on their resorts and we can confirm it was once more a trip that will remain on our thoughts for life. We like to thank all the crew with a special thanks to our GEM Shihan who helped us to have the best possible time during our stay and to MUI who allowed us to get in contact with the rich marine flora and fauna around the island and spotting sharks, turtle and sting ray were highlights of the trip. As expected the food from all the restaurants was by itself a great experience, with a lot of variety to choose from and we highly recommend the full board. The 48 options of ice cream and the affection with‚Ä¶"
"By far this is the best resort I've ever stayed in. All the people are so friendly on the island. Also sixth sense have kept their island very nice and very clean, which the coral reefs are very nice outside the Chill Bar, you will see a lot of fishes there! Last and not least, the food was amazing here. I would give everything A+ such as customer service, food, snorkeling and environment."
"We couldn‚Äôt have started better our honeymoon. Best place I have ever been. Really nice and friendly staff, mainly our GEM Abdulla Hassan, who was in charge of taking care of us and did it wonderfully! The food is great and there‚Äôs a lot of options. You have even the chance of spending a whole day in a private island. For sure the best experience we had in our lifetime. I hope to be back soon!"
"We came to SS Laamu for our honeymoon and it completely blew away our high expectations. We stayed at an overwater villa with a pool and it truly is your own personal Paradise  From the moment you arrive, you are greeted by an amazing staff who go above and beyond to make your trip perfect. Everyone receives a personal GEM who is your Experience Manager for the week and Aslah was amazing. He helped us to coordinate all our excursions and meals and ensured we had everything we needed the entire trip  Every meal was incredible, and you will never rub out of options for what to eat, but some of the highlights are the breakfast at Longitude, the Asian market night (every Friday night) and Leaf where our server Leevan took care of us. We managed to spend many days at the Chill Bar‚Ä¶"
"From the moment we arrived at the resort, the service at the Six Senses Laamu has been nothing short of incredible.   We thoroughly enjoyed snorkelling with Greg who is a member of the marine team, had an incredible massage by Bo at the spa, was served impeccably during our dinners by ALL the waitstaff but especially Hisham and Leevon, constantly fed yummy ice cream by the ever joyful ice cream lady, served delicious cocktails by Vignesh the lead bartender (who even made bespoke cocktails for us!) and  were so well taken care of by our GEM Aslah. The list goes on and on and on‚Ä¶   We highly recommend staying here and are already looking at booking our next trip!"
"I‚Äôm an event planner and have scouted many resorts internationally, but Six Senses blew me away for my honeymoon vacation! Every resort experience detail was thoughtfully and flawlessly executed by the staff. It‚Äôs a honeymoon paradise, which offered us many generous complimentary amenities.  Unfortunately, I was sick for the first few days, but Thohir our GEM (Guest Experience Maker) took excellent care of me and made sure that I received the care needed to get well and return to my vacation asap. He had many guests but always made us feel like we were his only guest and provided a huge comfort to me when I thought that I would get better.   The welcome we received upon arrival by the hotel staff is warm and set the tone for the excellent services to come. The only thing that‚Ä¶"
"The moment we set foot on the island, everything was magical. From the staff to amenities and activities, everything was wonderfully curated and thought of. Even though my partner was sick for the first few days, Our wonderful GEM Thohir took care of us. Can‚Äôt wait to come back again!"
"This is our first experience in Maldives and it was just amazing,unforgettable honeymoon for us.Restaurant Zen and Leaf are our favorite ones,did snorkeling with a marine biologist. Weather was windy but better than rainy.We really enjoyed. Especially thanks to Ainura for making our stay memorable."
"2.nd visit....still an amazing place. The staff is fantastic, the food great, the Villas really nice and the island is beautiful. The house reef is accessible and OK but not amazing. The kids club is the best in the maldives!. The best thing is that the staff is kind, attentive, personal and genuinely cares about thier guests. Six Senses Laamu is clearly one of the top resorts in the Maldives."
"My wife and I will always remember our journey to this incredible little island world. The up-close experiences with turtles, rays, sharks, fish, coral, and crabs were moments we hoped for and made us feel very connected to the Laamu environment which is so wonderfully cared for by everyone at Six Senses. Shah took great care of us. We enjoyed many nice conversations with him and several other team members including Ibbe, Alvina, Aabi, Raif, Niyaz, and Hishaam. The Dhoni sail and private beach bbq were very romantic and highly recommend for couples interested. Make sure to enjoy the beautiful sunrises, sunsets, and night skies. We had restorative and relaxing times at the spa including massage, meditation, and exercise and enjoyed getting to know the spa and fitness team. Asian‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses Laamu - just WOW!  My husband and I spent 6 nights in an over water villa for our honeymoon. There are so many great things to say about our experience! I think what sticks out about this resort is the staff and customer service. From the staff at the Male airport helping you with luggage and check-in, to your GEM at the resort who checks in on you daily, to the crew who brings you to and from Male on the speedboat and the staff who also assists you on your return back to Male to your final destination. I am just simply blown away at the level of service the Six Senses staff provides.  A special shout out to our GEM, Aslah who was amazing! He checked in on us daily to ensure we were reminded of our planned activities, and assisted us in whatever we needed. He took the‚Ä¶"

He is just born for the service and hospitality industry and absolutely thrives in his role. Shah was available to us 24/7 and helped us plan our entire stay on the island - from arranging snorkeling tours to booking dinner reservations every night.   Some notable highlights:  - Snorkelling off the back of the villa right onto the house reef and being surrounded by so many tropical fish and coral   - breakfast buffet is a gorgeous spread filled with so many‚Ä¶"
"Wonderfull experience with my wife. Service is outstanding, very nice & friendly! Location is perfect, activities are also great. Nevertheless, a little paradise on earth, food in all the restaurants are amazing. Snorkelling & the water sports are the musts to try.  mostly thanks to all the employees. Special shout out  to our GEM Aslah who was very helpful through out our stay. we will be back."
"We stayed for 7 days at Six Senses, it is a hotel which offers luxury, relax, all kind of services a GEM for each guest who will organize or arrange anything you wish!  It has many areas and you will not see a lot of guests around.  Room: 10/10 Service: 10/10 Food: 10/10 Activities: 10/10 Sealife: 10/10 Overall: 10/10  We will be back some day for sure.  Special thanks to our GEM Shihan for all the arrangements."
"An absolutely amazing honeymoon! We were well looked after from start to finish. The service here is faultless. We stayed in a lagoon water villa and we were so impressed with the villa and stunning views. The choice of restaurants and food is superb. We loved the concept of sustainable, environmentally friendly living on the island. The ‚Äòno shoes, no news‚Äô policy is a great one and it was difficult putting shoes back on at the end of the stay. The snorkelling was amazing too, we saw 3 turtles during our stay which we had never seen before anywhere else.  The service at the spa was excellent and we both enjoyed a full body massage which was very relaxing in a beautiful setting. A special mention to our GEM, Aslah. Nothing was ever too much trouble and he made sure we had the‚Ä¶"
"What an amazing place to visit for our honeymoon. The accommodation, service and food was exceptional. The relaxed atmosphere, superb facilities and staff really made everything stress free. Would highly recommend a visit here. Special thanks to Maduka for his amazing cocktails, to Mahid for his friendly service and to Aslah our top class GEM who was a legend throughout the stay. Hope to see you all again some time."
"Shihan was our GEM during our honeymoon. always attentive and concerned about providing us with the best experiences. assisted us in scheduling activities, tours and dinners. It was a wonderful experience that we will definitely want to repeat!"
"Fantastic vacation at Six Senses Laamu! We learned that all team members are offered a comprehensive training program for professional and personal development. I am convinced that this is the foundation of why we felt so welcome and had a great experience with all the team we met: our Gem (the guest experience manager) was taking great care of us from the start to the very end, the service and kitchen team offered an amazing culinary experience, great conversations with the bar team, fantastic experience with the MUI at the house reef, great tour with the sustainability manager, and always a good time at the chocolate and ice bar! Besides, the Covid safety measures make sense and hopefully keep the resort save and open. Many thanks to the entire team for a fantastic time!"
"The ultimate escape, effortless luxury and outstanding service by the six senses team. Special mention to the spa team and to our GEM, Shah, who took care of any request we had (or thought we could have) including sunset dolphin cruising, candlelit beach dinners and even arranging for us to watch the latest episode of Succession on a private viewing on the beach! A very special place and one we could not recommend enough."
"This hotel is fantastic! Everything was perfect.  We stayed at see water bungalow, it was perfect. The service is very nice and all very kind staff. Aslah, our Gem, was very attentive and take care of us all trip.  The highlight of the trip was the desert island tour,  We loved all."
"If you are planning your trip and wondering if this place is great to visit or if you already booked it and just looking to see if you're going to have a great time be aware you're going to have such  great time it's going to be hard for you to leave. We have spent a week here and it's definitely not enough.  Marvelous place in beautiful settings with terrific service and amazing food - what else can you wish for your vacation? Special thanks to our GEM, Shah, who made all the arrangements for us, dinners, snorkeling, cooking class, etc. Shah is a very helpful person with such a can-do attitude and  a wonderful smile.  This place is true Magic Kingdom for a vacation, for both adults and kids.  Huge thanks to spa therapists Bo and Divyani, Adam for the sustainability tour, Abi‚Ä¶"
"Six senses Maldives was far and away the best vacation I‚Äôve ever been on. The grounds are stunning, the staff is amazing, and the food is excellent. I have no feedback since everything was absolutely perfect. Shah our GEM was so helpful and planned all our activities during our stay. Would 100% recommend and we are sad to leave!!"
We had an unbelievable time at Six Senses Laamu. The best trip and honeymoon we could ask for. Our JEM Shah was outstanding and accommodated all of our needs. The entire staff couldn‚Äôt have been more accommodating. The grounds are absolutely stunning and pristine and the bungalows are incredible. Each and every restaurant was outstanding and we enjoyed the food. Levon at leaf restaurant was an excellent waiter. Abidja who worked at the ice cream parlor served us every day with a smile. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better time!
"This is truly paradise from the moment we arrived.   Six Senses has a relaxed | care free ambience throughout the resort surrounded by beautiful views and lush greenery.  One of the best water villas I have stayed in with spectacular views. The villa is extremely unique with great decor and amenities. I loved the personalisation and attention to detail.  Wonderful dining | lounge and bar areas to relax and dine at.  In addition there is a lovely private wine cellar to dine at as well as a complimentary ice cream bar.   Great outdoor pool and beach areas and to mark special occasions, there is an outdoor theatre. Something quite unique and private.  The cuisine was superb and we were spoiled for choice.   The highlight of our stay was the amazing spa experience. What a beautiful‚Ä¶"
"This was absolute perfection - complete heaven. I have stayed in a number of places in the Maldives and Six Senses is by far my favourite. All the normal things you expect in the Maldives - friendly people, blue blue sky and turquoise sea. However, this was so much more - the vibe is wonderfully relaxed, completely delicious food, more turquoise sea than ever before, well appointed and very comfortable villas over the sea, turtles, rays, shells - everything."
"Perfect holidays in a great resort. Effortless luxurious with the staff making the experience super special! We would go back anytime and unconditionally recommend to friends. Special thanks to Shah - our GEM, the villa attendants for keeping the villa in order, the water sports team for a super special private snorkeling/island hopping trip by speed boat, the bar tenders at Chill bar for delicious drinks and the service teams in all of the restaurants for attentive and perfect service!"
My wife and I had an incredible honeymoon at SS Laamu. The service is top-notch from the moment we arrived to the speedboat on the way home. Every need was addressed and our GEM Aslah went above and beyond to make sure we have an unforgettable and special honeymoon. Would recommend SS to anyone looking to experience paradise on earth. We are now SS loyal and look forward to returning to Laamu and other SS properties around the world!
"Fabulous food - there was not a single dish I did not like; extremely friendly and supportive staff, always ensuring that the guests are pampered, so that they can utmost enjoy their holidays, great reef to snorkel and an inspiring effort on sustainability."
"We spent only few days in Six Senses Laamu  for our honeymoon and it was incredible!  The staff were very friendly and welcoming. You can really feel the positive vibes there!  We stayed in the Laamu over water villa with pool. The villa was really nice and the atmosphere was really therapeutic! The staff who were assigned with us during our stay (Anu) was super friendly as well.   However, the hotel is a bit far from the Airport and also, their diving center was a bit unorganized. If I had the chance to visit maldives again, I will definitely choose Six Senses!"
"We went to Six Senses Laamu on our Honeymoon and it couldn't have been better! the Hotel is wonderful and surprises in the details and care of the entire team, without exception. Our Gem, Aslah, was always very helpful, making our stay as pleasant as possible. The hotel, in addition to being in a wonderful place, has a sustainable philosophy that integrates with nature. It's an experience. I highly recommend it!"
simply excellent hotel !! live up to expectations! this together with all the staff and in particular with our ghem Saha ... our stay at the Six Senses has been perfect! now until you discover a new Six Senses!
"Everything about Six Senses Laamu is perfect. Starting with the help at Male airport to collecting your bags from your villa when you leave.  We travelled for our delayed honeymoon and couldn‚Äôt have picked a better resort. The hosts remembered us and our dietary requirements while the daily set menus at the incredible Leaf (Mediterranean) and Zen (Japanese) restaurants were adjusted.  Our dedicated guest experience manager, Aslah, ensures we were booked on all of the activities we wanted to do and was always on hand to help us.  The snorkelling was incredible with the number of reefs and we even saw turtles. As first timers we had loads of help and could borrow life jackets to feel safe.  Similarly, Stephanie, Luke and Umar at tropic surf were so helpful with a few introductory‚Ä¶"

We knew when it came to our honeymoon, we wanted it to be as stress free, joyful, and memorable as possible. Our stay at Six Senses Laamu has been the dreamiest week of our lives, after a trying couple of years, and we owe it all to the fabulous staff. We want to give a huge-out to Shah, our GEM (or personal concierge) for his thoughtfulness in planning every moment of our stay, Rahul at Longitude who made us feel extremely welcome every morning at breakfast with a tray of our favorite fresh fruit, and Afaz who was our kind, curious, and enthusiastic snorkel guide.

"We stayed in a Laamu water villa on Pier C for eight nights.  Wonderful location, and very private. The service was top notch from start to finish. Genuinely friendly and helpful staff. I would like to thank our personal guide Shah especially.  Food and beverages are high quality. The area is very clean and well kept.  We had an amazing time at Six Senses Laamu."
"Since the moment we have been greeted at the airport, everything has been flowless. The service, attention to detail, friendliness of the staff, the food, house reef and marine life, and the whole experience has been one of a kind. A really special island with turquoise ocean and white sandy beach. Definitely highly recommended to anyone (couples, families, friends) looking for a wonderful escape."
"This was our first time visiting the Maldives and we loved our stay. We would most likely return, though we have a few points for improvement.   THE POSITIVES Much has been said in past reviews so I will only highlight a few things that stood out for us. The location is absolutely stunning. No matter where you are on the small island, everything is beautiful and serene. It looks exactly like the pictures.  Maybe even better.   We've stayed at Six Senses properties previously and are happy to say that this one fits in perfectly with the brand and what it stands for. Laid-back, unpretentious luxury is paired with sustainable practices like reducing waste, sourcing locally and giving back to the community. A no shoe policy is an absolute winner, as are little touches like a wedding‚Ä¶"
"The trip getting  to the island for us was a little hard, especially with the prop plane and the rough weather.  However,  once we arrived it was all worth it. We stayed in an overwater villa with a view that I could not get over. This isn‚Äôt my first time in the Maldives, but the beauty of this place is amazing. Our villa was in Lagoon C which is where a lot of the turtles like to go and eat seagrass. The sea life is so abundant even straight from the villa. You get around by bike, and while riding to breakfast you might see iguanas or crabs. Even though the resort was fully booked it never felt crowded.   Were given a wonderful GEM, Shah, who went out of his way to make it a special vacation for us. We were celebrating our anniversary and he had a cake sent to us and a bottle‚Ä¶"
"As soon as you step foot on the dock at Six Senses Laamu, you know you have stepped into paradise.  Warm greetings by the Six Senses Laamu team pave the way for your sensational stay.  The idyllic setting with crystal blue waters, soft white sand beaches, and endless sky will take your breath away.  The food is plentiful, fresh, delicious, and decadent.  It tantalizes the taste buds.  Having gardens onsite offers fresh produce that only adds to the culinary delights awaiting you at the various amazing restaurants on the island.  Kudos must go out to all the restaurant staff.  Food is prepared from the heart and quality and quantity are left to be desired.  At the resort, you will become addicted to some of the best ice cream and sorbet you will ever have.  My G.E.M (Guest‚Ä¶"
"We had a wonderful two week holiday here at the end of the summer. Despite the season the island never felt crowded and there were plenty of opportunities to do all the activities and spa sessions we wanted. Every single staff member was friendly and helpful and often went above and beyond our expectations. Abdulla, our GEM, was phenomenal and he made every day feel special and personally designed. His experience and knowledge of the island was invaluable to us throughout.   All of the food was delicious and even though Zen was our favourite restaurant, the private sommelier dinner was the best meal we had. Thank you Six Senses for making our summer holiday truly unforgettable. The Sunset villas are also perfectly placed and I highly recommend the turtle safari tour! Just‚Ä¶"
"Great Resort, amazing food and very friendly stuff. Especially our GEM, Mr. Shah and as well all the waitresses at the bar and restaurants made the experience perfect. The Chef de cousin prepares food at highest level and with lots of passion. The swell was quite small but the surf anyway was lots of fun. Thanks to the guys and girls from Tropical surf, they support as well the little surfers and kids. We like the sustainability idea a lot."
"Fabolous eco resort with amazing facilities for all the members of our family. One of the best kids club ( thanks Zahee and Vicky), service ( big love and thank to our GEM Ashlah) and surf team ( Robin, Umar) have made our stay a wonderful experience."
"We chose Six Senses to celebrate our 15th anniversary, along with our 2 children (6-year old and a 6-month old). The experience was amazing and what set this place apart is having a Guest Express Maker (GEM) taking care of you the whole stay. Our GEM was Shah and he made our stay a memorable experience. We stayed at one of the overwater villas over the lagoon, which was great and gave access to snorkeling and amazing views. Our daughter loved the kids club and movie nights. My wife and I enjoyed the relaxing time, great food and disconnecting from the world for 5 days.  Although the trip to the resort requires multiple legs of travel (another flight from Male and then a boat ride), it is worth the visit!"
"I absolutely loved my time at Six Senses Laamu. My wife & I visited the resort on our honeymoon at the end of October / beginning of November and stayed for 12 nights.   Staff - The staff were all very friendly and helpful. In particular the GEM‚Äôs Shah & Wasil were excellent and often helped scheduling activities and took initiative when they thought it might be best to book additional activities or reschedule existing ones as a result of weather or other reason. Shah often suggested taking additional pictures and went above and beyond in ensuring we had a great experience.

Aside from the beauty of the resort, one of the (many) things that really stood out to us was the service.

From arranging beautiful private dinners, to yoga lessons to snorkel trips, he was so on top of everything. It was the best balance of being helpful and giving us time together as a couple.

Friendly and knowledgeable and always with a smile. Special thanks to our GEM Shah, dive master Dottie and kids club host Vicky and the entire Marin Biologist staff. Very interesting to be able to learn more about the Marin life having several Marin biologists on the island.  Food was also very good.  Thank you all for a great stay! We would absolutely recommend Six senses Lamu."
"From the moment we entered Male airport we felt the unrivalled Six Senses‚Äô hospitality. Our Six Senses rep handled everything at the airport in a smooth and professional manner. We could tell straight away what we were about to experience at the resort.   My husband and I carried out extensive research before booking our honeymoon to the Maldives. We looked into almost every resort within our price range (and some even well above). It was very apparent that Six Senses scored above and beyond on all accounts.   Just some of the amazing aspects that made Six Senses Laamu an experience of a lifetime for us: - Our lagoon water villa. Simply stunning eco-friendly interior and exterior design. They thought of everything from an aesthetic, practical and environmental point of view.‚Ä¶"
"Words simply don‚Äôt do this place or it‚Äôs staff justice. Six Senses Laamu is a truly unspoilt natural paradise with very special people working there. They somehow manage to blend pure luxury with sustainable tourism and make you feel like you are part of the community in helping them preserve the island‚Äôs marine life and natural beauty. They do this by offering many educational sessions about the measures that they take to ensure sustainability such as recycling seawater and making things out of natural materials and offering talks about what they are doing to preserve their environment. They have just become a Hope spot!   The service is exemplary, nothing is too much trouble and you are greeted by everyone with a smile. They have a concept where you have a General Experience‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses Laamu is something out of a dream. It couples true relaxation with the most scenic of views. The food is outstanding from the Longitude dinner buffet, amazing breakfast buffet, as well as unique dining experiences such as ‚ÄúDinner in the Dark‚Äù where you are blindfolded for an evening of wine and dinner tasting with a sommelier (Karim, head sommelier is fantastic!).  Aslah, one of the resorts GEMs, truly made our trip special. He was so kind and friendly. Aslah went above and beyond to make sure we were aware daily of what the resort had to offer to create our unique Maldives experience. We always looked forward to speaking with him and learning more about not only the resort, but also the Maldivian culture. We left our trip feeling as though we made a great friend.  ‚Ä¶"

Whether it was reservations or providing information about other excursions or answering our touristy questions about the Maldives he does it all‚Ä¶.day or night.   The island resort has a little bit of everything from relaxing spa, delicious food, snorkeling from your villa or just relaxing by the pool. Our villa was impeccably cleaned every day by Muhammad and he always checked in to make sure we had everything we needed. The resort has truly thought of everything from rain jackets and umbrellas just in case, to natural aloe for after sun care, to bicycles with custom initial plates to hop around the island you couldn‚Äôt ask for anything else.

"Spent a wonderful honeymoon on the isle. Beautiful location, sublime food, uncrowded feel on the beach with extremely clear turquoise water. Regularly saw turtles, reef sharks and stingrays, and enjoyed the snorkelling off the Chill Bar. Water villa (jetty c) was fantastic. Thoroughly enjoyed the bare foot experience and the cycling through the sandy  trails through the trees. What put the icing on the cake was without exception the staff‚Ä¶hugely friendly and helpful with special mentions to Anim, Na√Øf, Shuaau, and Niaz‚Ä¶.and all the rest.

"My 8 year son and I just spent a truly wonderful week at Six Senses Laamu. Still miss the cycling with bare feet and my early morning strolls in total peace. We equally loved the beach villa with pool and the overwater villa. The sincere kindness of all people working here stands out, the service is amazing throughout. The quality of the food, the careful checking each time on my dietary requirements, the unbelievably relaxing quality of the spa treatments (shout out to Lucy!), the wonderful icecream parlour with an even lovelier lady serving the ice creams. I can go on and on. I recommend keen snorkelers to book one or more private trips to the Coral Garden. Very good snorkelling about 20 minutes by speedboat ride.

"Everything about our stay at Six Senses Laamu was truly wonderful. As a foodie and wine lover, my palate was very happy each and every day. The chili table tasting dinner, set in the  herb garden, was a unique culinary experience. Local chilis infused into each dish. Our waiter Hassaan was so hospitable and taught us many things about the island and its cuisine. Our Around the World wine pairing dinner with Kareem & was so delicious. That lobster with vanilla cream sauce was unforgettable. We also enjoyed our Maldivian cooking class experience with Chef Aarif and our Maldivian picnic during our day trip experience to a private island. All of the food was outstanding, but the cocktails and wines were equally delicious. We enjoyed our Bartenders challenge cocktail experience and‚Ä¶"
For my wife and I this trip had been over 10 years in the making as we had been saving every month for this to celebrate our 10th anniversary. We really had a wonderful experience from beginning to end at Six Senses Laamu.  When we got on the boat for the airport we were greeted with a cold drink and a bag to place our shoes in. Going around the resort barefoot is encouraged and we did not put our shoes back on for the rest of our stay.  The resort has an air of understated elegance.  You feel very much in nature with touches of luxury throughout. You are given a bike at your villa check in. This serves as the primary means of transport around the island.

"Our experience at Six Senses Laamu was amazing.   This place is paradise.     Their no shoe policy is a genius idea.  From the moment you arrive you can't help but kick-back & unplug.   The staff are genuinely warm, friendly & so helpful.  A few shout outs. Thohir, our GEM, was a true gem, always there to suggest things to do, answer our every need & also to surprise us.  Thank you again for organizing the incredibly delicious birthday cake, made from chocolate crafted by the resorts own chocolatier.    Bo & the skilled spa staff soothed & re-energized us with their expert massages.  To all of the staff thank you for making this stay so memorable.  We are looking forward to returning to Six Sense Laamu & hopefully staying longer next time!"
"Amazing environment, amazing people in the hotel. They really made the difference in our experience. Abdulla was the gentleman that took care of us, he lead the hotel‚Äôs team to make this experience unique and print these days in our mind forever."
"During the last week, we are having an amazing experience at Six Senses Maldives. Besides the view (it is the paradise in Earth) , we are having the opportunity to be cared by the Six Senses Team.  Led by Abdulla, everyone was focused to offer the best experience to us, specially with my diet . As I am celiac , all the care is being  taken during my stay . We want to thank you for those special days."
"I stayed in a beach villa with my husband, 2y son and mum, and we couldn't be more satisfied! the food was amazing, our villa magnificent, and all the team was very friendly and helpful! Specially our GEM Aslah was the best, always attentive and trying to make sure we were happy. Vicky and the 2 other girls who worked in the kids club were so affectionate with my son and all the kids, its an amazing hotell to bring your children! Asif also very nice, helpful and competent, making sure our room was perfect!"
"We had a perfect time in our honeymoon! Our jem Hamzath was perfect, kindly and friendly with us ‚Ä¶ he was responsible all the time for our perfect experience here. My advice for others couple in honeymoon are don‚Äôt miss the privite picnic in the island and sandbank barbecue at night, we had an unforgettable experiences in our life‚Äôs. It was amazing trip. Dreams come true."
"Just returned from the most amazing family holiday in paradise! White beaches, turquoise waters, incredible marine life, amazing food, a water villa over the ocean plus the exceptional service levels of the Six Senses teamI Highly recommended and well worth the travel to get there. Holiday of a lifetime!"
"Had the most wonderful time & experience at Six senses Laamu.All aspects of the stay so well taken care of by GEMs(Guest Experience Manager) & our GEM,Ainura was such sweet & caring person seeing to it that we had the best & memorable stay considering the fact that my husband & I were celebrating our 25 years of marriage. Every staff member there is always ready to listen to you & help you out with anything & everything.One feels so much at home at Sixsenses Laamu. Would certainly visit this place again!..it is an experience by itself!  Sharmila Y Chennai"
"Our stay at Six Senses Laamu was incredible. As the only resort in the entire atoll it really feels like you‚Äôre in the middle of nowhere, despite EVERY detail and luxury being handled by the resort. My wife loved spotting turtles directly off our overwater villa. As an avid surfer, I had a number of bucket list type experiences surfing 5 different spots in the atoll - all completely empty (Petrols and Machines were particularly epic!). Huge thanks to our Guest Experience Manager - Aslah - and the entire TropicSurf crew for making this a trip of a lifetime!"
"Five Stars. Everything perfect, our GEM Hazmath and the rest of the staff super friendly and helpful.  Kavish, very good always trying to help!  Great vacations! I recommend to everyone, I would not change a thing"
"I'm not sure where to start with a review, other than to highly recommend this resort (if you can afford it!).  The resort's 'no shoes' policy + biking was excellent. It re-enforced that we were on vacation in a remote place and we were sad putting shoes back on the boat ride home :).  The villas and everything else were top notch. One thing that stuck out was that the  water sports equipment was all high quality and some of the latest tech which I appreciated.  The food was everything you could hope for. A wide variety of cuisines in a wide variety of formats (fine dining, casual dinner, buffet, beach dinner, etc etc).  Our favorite part of the vacation was definitely the Marine biology snorkeling tour. We snorkeled different parts of the reef everyday after doing that tour. It‚Ä¶"
"We went to spend our honeymoon. From the Beginning the attention was excellent. Our GEM Ainura took care of us and made us feeling as in the paradise. Villas are awesome, very nice views, room services very very carful. Waitress very friendly specially 'Shark' and 'Anser', always giving you the correct attention. Restaurants with delicious dishes and differents atmosphere: Sip Sip, Chill Bar, Leaf Restaurant... They have a kitchen with a level as best restaurants in the world, excellent products and very professional chefs. Also there are lot of activities to do,  snorkel (with a professional staff), kayak, windsurfing) or just have a drink in very comfortable hammock or in a very nice swimming pool infinity. For us has been the best Resost we have been ever. 200% RECOMMENDED"
"Amazing stay at Six Senses Laamu. Beautiful island with a great house reef, plenty of wildlife both on the island and off including Lizards, fruit bags, sharks, turtles and rays.   The food was good and we thought the best places to eat were Leaf and SipSip. The Asian street food Buffett was excellent and the Lobster dinner delicious although on the pricey side.   The dolphin sunset cruise was great fun and got up and close with several Spinner dolphins.   The bars were great with some awesome cocktails. A special mention to Kavesh the bar manager as well as Mario and Makuda behind the bar.   The Den/Kids club was brilliant and Vicky and her staff looked after our children excellently and the movie nights were great for looking after them.   The Ice cream at ICE was a lovely‚Ä¶"
"Literal heaven on earth, I don't even know where to begin. From the moment we stepped foot on the island to the last second before leaving, it was a literal dream. We stayed for 6 nights in a Sunset Laamu overwater bungalow. The view from these specific bungalows allows for direct sunset watching from the deck and it's extremely beautiful. Our GEM, Hamzath, was the absolute best. He made our experience so perfect. He was always there to help whether it was to book activities, make dinner reservations, see how our day was going, etc. Every single employee on the island is seriously so friendly and amazing.   The resort has soooo many activities and excursions to book. We didn't do half of the activities they offer but we still felt like we did a lot. We did the Maldivian cooking‚Ä¶"
"We had a 5 day stay at Six Senses Laamu, and it was literally like a slice of paradise. The island is too too beautiful, our villa was better than we imagined. The food is way too delicious with all the fresh produce they have. The staff is extremely courteous all of them pamper you a lot (to name a few our GEM Aslah, Dive center Jessie, message therapists, Vicky and Asana from kids den etc.). Although we are not adventurous kind, but we had fun kayaking and snorkelling. They have very nice corals and reef and so many fishes. We are literally awestruck and are taking back memories to cherish for life."
"We h√°d a great maldivian Experiences, sofra the best of our Life. And we erre greated with the management Team And everyone wats s√≥ lovingly friendly And always smiling that we felt in home. Our gem Hamzath always greet us with a smile And arranged Everything up to perfection leaving us worry less And only thing we had to do was relax And enjoy. We loved it s√≥ much it was the trip of our Life And we are coming Back. They are environmental friendly And very sustainable which makes a Huge difference. Niyaz from zen is very Funny And always Keeps us entertained Every where we meet Tip: try the snorkeling tour"
"We stayed in an ocean water villa as part of our Honeymoon. Our guest experience maker (gem) Abdulla made our stay unforgettable by ensuring every possible need was tended to including meal bookings, covid admin, activity bookings etc. he went above and beyond! Food in all 4 of the restaurants was exceptional, weather was incredible and facilities were brilliant. One thing above all which stood out was the friendliness of every single member of staff at six senses! Just an amazing team and a credit to the brand!"
"Honestly won‚Äôt be able to thank enough people in this review for how magical our stay was. The attention to people and to the details from all staff, both front of house and behind the scenes, is second to none.   The food is outstanding and the huge variety on offer caters for everyone. While we were staying we had theme nights of Mediterranean, Thai, Asian and Tapas. The restaurants Leaf and Zen are must tries. Huge thank you to all the chefs that work so hard to provide such a wonderful dining experience each and every night. It‚Äôs worth mentioning as well that I have a severe nut allergy and not only were all the staff aware, on the theme nights the chefs personally took me through each dish to tell me how it was made and what went into it for my complete peace of mind.

"Six Sences laamu is just amazing! Beautiful scenery, incredible food and all the staff are friendly, warm and make sure you have an amazing time.   Aslah our GEM was great and made sure everything during our stay went smoothly. The staff in chill bar were great, delicious cocktails and excellent club sandwiches! The lobster BBQ on the beach and the food at Zen were two particular highlights amongst in a week of incredible food. Would recommend a stay here to away that will listen."
"We have just returned from a week at Six Senses Laamu and wanted to share our amazing experience.  The photos show that the island is a little spot of paradise in the Indian Ocean.  When you are there though, you appreciate that the photos do not actually do the resort justice.  Whilst visually it is the best place I have ever stayed, there was so much more which warranted a 5 star review.  From the moment we picked up our bags in Mal√© and were met by one of the Six Senses staff, it felt like the whole team were delighted we had decided to stay with them.  Everyone we encountered did everything they could to ensure we had a great time, from a wave and a smile when cycling past, to ensuring we got one more order in before the end of happy hour.  Each guest is assigned a Guest‚Ä¶"
"Went here for our honeymoon and could not have been happier with the choice. Our GEM (Guest Experience Maker), Shah, made the trip carefree and took care of our every wish while the rest of the staff also provided us with top accommodations. Shuaau was very attentive at many happy hours and meals while the tropic surf group on property was very helpful in and out of the water."
"We had an absolute dream honeymoon at Six Senses Laamu! Our GEM, Shah, was so helpful in making our stay comfortable and fun. When we weren‚Äôt running into him throughout the resort, we knew he was only a phone call or WhatsApp message away. In addition to Shah, the entire staff at Six Senses Laamu made us feel so welcomed and well cared for throughout our stay. A few stand-outs were Hisham and Ansaar, with whom we dined several times and enjoyed getting to know them and appreciated how they took an interest in us and our likes and dislikes throughout the meals.   The food, views, and sustainability of this resort are all  absolutely incredible. Whether we were lounging at our villa or enjoying an excursion, every moment was impressive and special. I highly recommend Six Senses‚Ä¶"

Another special thanks for the lady of the ice cream, she is super fun üòä.  The hotel is perfect‚Ä¶ our room was super confortable and the place is a paradise, the most beatifull place i ever been."
"Six Senses Laamu delivers on all fronts for a great island escape. We‚Äôve travelled to a few resorts in the Maldives and at Six Senses they‚Äôve managed to get it all right: I‚Äôve done the research, this is the one  Our gem of a Gem, Aslah, looked after every one of our needs, not an easy feet as at one point our group swelled to 20people between the ages of 9 and 76years. The rest of the staff are incredible, all friendly and sincere and happy to help 24/7. Marteyne and her team are unbeatable.  Quiet, varied surf breaks are a treat for any surfer & these excursions are managed by the awesome TropicSurf team led by Hamish and Holly. Beginner to advanced levels will find their vitamin Sea in abundance.  Incredible diving, a beautiful house reef within splashing distance of‚Ä¶"
"Amazing bliss  Perfect resort for a de-sressing hollidays Amazing villas, food and people. Especially the beach lobster bbq and the leaf restaurant are recommended.  The overwater villas with pool are recommanded for pricacy - but all of them are great.  Special thanks to Aslah our gem that took care of the smallest details for us"
"For the over-water bungalow honeymoon experience, this place is unmatched. From the sustainability initiatives, barefoot vibe, amazing cuisine, to the top-tier snorkeling just a splash away from the dock, we had the most amazing time ever! Our GEM, Shah, took the absolute best care to make sure we had the most fun, special, and relaxing experience possible. We can't wait to come back, and to see what other Six Senses properties around the world have to offer us!"
"We decided on Six Senses for our honeymoon and needless to say, everything was absolutely perfect. From the moment we arrived on the island, we were greeted by the best Guest Experience Manager anyone could ask for (Shah), who made sure we were extremely well taken care of the entire time. The island itself is great with plenty of activities for all types of people, but his guidance, friendliness, and dedication to make sure we were completely satisfied made the experience 1000x better. He truly understood what we were looking for and delivered every step of the way. We will definitely recommend this place to friends and family and one day, hope to be back to relive the magic!"
"An UNBELIEVABLE experience. By far one of our best holidays we have ever had. The resort is absolutely flawless, everything runs like a well-oiled machine. The attention to detail is impeccable - from the excellent design of the villas, to the food, the facilities and the holistic approach in all it offers. The staff go above and beyond to make you feel right at home. A special mention to Aslah, who did not miss a beat in terms of service and attentiveness to our large group. His patience, professionalism, kindness, friendliness and service was unmeasurable. He made our stay seamless and that much more enjoyable.  SixSenses Lammu is paradise and will without doubt recommend this resort to many."
"Six Sense Laamu is an incredible resort in Maldives with BEST hospitality and services like Spa, Surf lessons, snorkeling...  Our GEM Shah made our stay un SixSense Laamu really amazing, and also all staff of breakfast and swimmimg pool.  Here you can choose each dinner between 3 restaurants and have lunch in other 2 different restaurants. Food is very very tasty and dayly activities of high value.  Cinema under the stars was amazing and surfing also.  SixSense is ecofriendly.  Highly remmended."
"we have been @ Six Senses Laamu to celebrate our 20th wed anniversary. 1st class service since our arrival at the gate departure. Resort representatives are very kind and available any time. it takes time to get the resort - 1 flight, 1 boat trip. but the service offered, make it easier. Since the arrival, we have been welcomed by Resort manager, general manager and several other resort team. We were in very good care during our entire stay for all staff. GEM (Guest Experience Maker) Abdulla - has made the total difference. Our stay @Six Senses Laamu was special because we have had Abdulla taking care of us and everything related to our stay.

"Where can I start? What an absolutely stunning, amazing, extraordinary place. We were treated with world class service from the second we landed in Male to the minute we left our luggage at check-in for departure. Each interaction with every person was a pleasant and heart warming experience.  Six Senses Laamu is a beauty of nature, not sure a place on earth can be more 'paradise' and that being said after we have visited most gems around the world. Six senses should be given extra kudos for putting the effort into respecting and nurturing the environment around them, it makes a difference and is very noticeable.   We stayed in an overwater villa most of the time, ending with a sunset overwater villa with a pool. The villas were beyond our expectations and we had wild‚Ä¶"

"Where to even start. First off, everything was amazing. We landed in MALE airport and was greeted by their staff to start the transfer process to get to the island. They took my husband and I to a lounge where they had complimentary food and drinks while we waited for the plane. The flight was sweet and short, like 30 mixtures. Once we landed at the small airport, we were once again greeted by six sense laamu staff and the took are bags to the speed boat. Water was a little choppy but the staff continued to check on us. They also told us that from that moment forward until our return that we were now going shoeless. You literally walk everywhere on the island bear footed. They helped us out of the boat and we were then greeted by the AMAZING staff. Patrick was the greeter and he‚Ä¶"
"The hotel is perfect! I had the most amazing moments there. The service is excellent, and specially the GEM who took care of us: Shah. He is the the best! The food, the spa and all the activities are amazing. I really recommend. I hope i came back soon."
"Six senses is more than a hotel. It is an unique experience.  Once you get there, everything will be perfect. And most of it because of the people who work there. We had the pleasure to have shah as our gem. He is simply the best!!! Always smiling, always ready to help with anything you need! We love him.  Also greg, the biologist, super nice guy. All the cookers and everyone from the restaurants, amazing people.  The spa is something from another planet. Best experience ever. The people from the spa are amazing!!!! Love it! The food is ridiculous good. Best risoto and best breakfast I had in my life. The room is perfection! Can get better than this. We love you guys, we already miss the hotel. The surf teacher is also super nice (forgot his name, he is from Australia, blonde). ‚Ä¶"
"I love the concent of Six Senses being so conected with nature and respect ecosystem so much.  You can‚Äôt get bored at Laamu, there are so many activities -great GYM, crystal singing bowl meditation, massage workshop, dolphin cruise or snorkeling.  Big plus for the complimentary ice cream -best in my whole life.  One of my favourite part of the day was breakfast -there was Naail -always smiling, helpful and makes our start of the day perfect.  Marine biologists are so great at the resort -we really enjoyed time spent with Afaz -he has such a positive vibe, snorkeling with him was a real adventure.  Also Peg the head marine biologist was ready to answer for our every question and explain with details everything about the underwater life.  GEM Shaah is top of the top!!! He was‚Ä¶"

GEM Shaah -true star of the resort, so involved, positive, helpful, always ready to makes you happy! I will come back here for sure!!!"
"The whole guest experience :) I loved it from the moment when arrived to the Airport through the way of welcoming me when I reached the resort. Having a personal assistant (ALI) with me all the time looking after me & my needs. lovely and friendly staff makes you feel like you're among family members Great services and delicious food everything, everything"
"The hotel is beautiful, the staff extremely kind, the food delicious and good variety. Many activities to do and amazing snorkel in the hotel beach. The island has a perfect size. You move by bike what is lovely."
"Incredible stay at six senses! Ainura, our GEM, made everything perfect for us. She‚Äôs super talented and finds the right dose of always being present without being intrusive. It‚Äôs also clear she really enjoys what she does, which makes her attention to her guests very natural.  We enjoyed very much the snorkel, scuba and activities, but the highlight was the service and the food. All restaurants are spectacular and the staff is always with a smile on their face willing to help whatever necessary.  Also, it was very different to have marine biologists at a resort. It was a fun way to understand more about the ecosystem in the island. Hadn‚Äôt seen this in any other resort.  Recommend doing the Wine dinner with Karim (hope I spelled his name correctly). It was fun, private and he‚Äôs‚Ä¶"
"Our stay at Six Senses Laamu was AMAZING!! Beyond what we were expecting, and we were with high expectations. Unlike most resorts in the Maldives, Six Senses has strong wellness vibe, very down to earth, but with a high luxury level. It is very supported on sustainability values. Most of the ingredients and products they use are grown by them (not only vegetables, but also they produce their own milk, water, jams, honey, and so on‚Ä¶). You get sustainability and wellness at high quality. About the service, it couldn‚Äôt be better! All the staff is super friendly and helpful. Always looking after you and anticipate what you might need / want. Every villa gets a GEM (guest experience manager). Ours was Abdulla and he went way and beyond what we expected! We didn‚Äôt have to worry about‚Ä¶"
"We had an absolutely magical 8-night stay that left us wishing we could stay longer!  It‚Äôs one of those places that just feels like home.   Getting there requires some extra effort (and expense), but it‚Äôs well worth it!  Just make sure you give yourself plenty of days to enjoy once you‚Äôre there. The one-hour domestic flight from Male is arranged by the hotel, and the resort staff ensures a hassle-free experience from the moment you arrive in the Maldives.   Our family stayed in a Family Villa with Pool, which has an additional study that can accommodate two children on a twin day bed and trundle, and it has an additional bathroom.   The room has castaway vibes with modern comforts and luxuries, like flat-screen TV, BOSE sound system, and a pillow menu with 9 different options.  ‚Ä¶"
"I stayed in the beach villa with pool. It had direct access to the beach with wonderful turquoise blue water. The different services offered by the hotel exceeded all my expectations, from the wide variety of food, to the sensory experience at the spa, to the amazing water activities. The marine world and the conversation with some of the hotel's team of marine biologists is simply wonderful.  The whole team was very attentive, anticipating our needs at all times. The philosophy of bare feet and cycling around the island made me fall in love with it. And if there is something special about this place, it is the passion for sustainability.  I give my stay at Six Senses Laamu a 10 - I'll be back!"
"Six Senses is a luxury brand that has the right values and will leave you feeling relaxed, and genuinely happy.  Six Senses Laamu is at the epitome of this group‚Äôs hotels and has incredible natural beauty, impeccable service from all staff, and the genuine feel of a private island. However, the most important quality which stands out above all is atmosphere. There is no judgement from hotel staff or guests, everyone is courteous, and you will be able to carry out your adventures in the most content manner.  Upon arrival you are greeted by your own personal GEM (guest experience manager) who will look after your every need.   Ours was Shah, who was truly exceptional. He has the most endearing personality and took care of all our needs at whichever hour. Always available 24/7 and‚Ä¶"

"We were so looking forward to our honeymoon at six senses and postponed several times. Having spent so long waiting and thinking about it I thought there was no way the holiday would meet my expectations but it was so much more than I could have imagined!  It was a beautiful honeymoon - Six Senses philosophy is one that ensures luxury but also keeping in mind the real essentials of a great holiday- happy and professional team, great food, good hospitality and beautiful untouched nature. Everything was taken care of for us that we could need without any hesitation.

Six Senses Laamu is real to its promise, unique experience, calm environment and a down-to-earth experience. We felt at peace the entire stay, enjoyed every meal, seem all meals prepared especially for your preference with big selection. Amazing spa treatments, had the best massage, Thank you Bo.

Definetively the best honeymoon resort around Maldives. There are a ton of activities every day that you can sign up for and they‚Äôre all fun and enjoyable. You can learn a lot about life in the island.   Staff is increadibly friendly and always willing to help with a smile. Our GEM host Ainura will go the extra mile to ensure our experience was a memorable one.   Definetively recommend this place to anyone looking to have a relaxing honeymoon adventure with lots of breathtaking views.
"Just left the six senses resort  and already miss it  Because everything was just perfect. The family ocean villa gave us a lot of privacy with plenty of space in the villa,  at our own pool and beach area. Our own GEM ‚ÄûSha‚Äú was very friendly and could solve all our problems like losing our keys two times. He had always a smile in his face and we miss him. As i am vegan i can recommend all spices so delicious and so special, just made with love. We will definitely  come again to this beautyful resort"
"My husband and I just returned from an 8-night stay in an overwater villa to celebrate our 10-year anniversary. Overall, our experience was beyond exceptional. From the moment we landed in Mal√© to the moment we departed, we had a Six Senses host coordinating and taking care of all elements of our experience. Coming from the US, this resort did require extensive travel (upwards of 30 hours from door-to-door) but I would consider it well worth the travel for the experience of a lifetime that this resort offered. Some of the highlights of our experience were:  Hosts. The first thing I have to mention is the people (hosts). The hospitality at the resort is truly 5-star, and guaranteed you will not worry about anything for the duration of your trip. Our interactions  with every host‚Ä¶"
"I‚Äôve been to Six Senses Laamu five times, and I can‚Äôt wait for my sixth. For short or extended stays, for action-packed or laid-back holidays, for gourmet indulgence or healthy spa cuisine, Six Senses has it all. Just book there now. You won‚Äôt regret it. "
"We just loved the experience at Six Senses Laamu. A wonderful place lead by great people. Everyone there was genuinely kind and helpful. Also, as tourists we should always support those initiatives that have sustainability among their top priorities."
"Not only for the luxury, but for the incredible team working there, Six Senses Laamu has no comparison in the Maldives. The sustainabitity effort the resort is doing it really makes the difference for those travelers looking for real care of the environment. The villas, the restaurants, the spa, the activities... The resort is really magnificent.    Special thanks for Leanna, Alex, Isha, the wonderful biologist Pip and  Marteyne, the director of the resort."

The resort is beyond beautiful!  Snorkeling and water will not disappoint."
"We went to the Six Senses Laamu for our honeymoon and we are used to travel and spend nights at good hotels and palaces.  During our trip we were surprised about the kindness and happiness of all the staff. We had a warm welcome from the team and we got all the explanations about the facilities and activities. Not even one day during our 11 days trip we feel bored.  Our GEM was Shah and I would like to share how helpful, kindly, available he was. He was one of the factor why we spend amazing time there.  Big up to Naiff, the waiter, and Rahuz, our morning fruit man, with whom we had a special connection due to their kindness and clients orientation.

"Could not have imagined a more perfect honeymoon. From the time we stepped on the island to the time we left, every aspect of our stay was a dream. The staff was amazingly friendly and went out of their way to make sure every aspect of our stay was perfect. Our GEM Hamzath was amazing and made our stay that much more special. From the experiences around the island, to the dining and food options, to just relaxing at our villa enjoying the sounds of the waves and watching the sea life, this was the trip of our dreams. We can't wait to come back and experience Six Senses again!"
"My wife and I spent two wonderful nights in Six senses Laamu. What an experience from the minute we arrived it was just an amazing experience. Room was super clean and everything you could have expected.

"It was our first time in the Maldives. Me and my wife decided to celebrate our aniversary with Six Senses and it was awesome. The property is just perfect and the natural beauty of the island makes it more than worth it. The team is so friendly that makes us feel like we were frequent guests. The hotel has a lot of restaurants and we had the chance to experience them all. Great cousine. The asian night was special for me.  A special thanks to our GEM (Ali), that made it all unforgettable."
"We just spent the most wonderful 2 weeks at Six Senses Laamu for our honeymoon this August/September. If you are wondering whether or not you should book at Six Senses Laamu, you can stop reading now. The answer is YES! This place truly has it all figured out. The scenery is beyond gorgeous, the staff is incredibly kind, engaging, and helpful, the activities (Diving, Spa, Snorkeling, etc) are top notch and the resort amenities are luxurious. Whether you're looking for a honeymoon destination, a family trip, or just a relaxing fun getaway, Six Senses Laamu has something for everyone.

"Literal heaven on earth. I went on my honeymoon with my wife for 2 weeks and there is not a single thing that wasn't perfect. My wife and I had high expectations, and they were absolutely blown away - the staff, the food, the service provided by the GEMs are all top, top notch.   Let me start with saying, if you are a serious diver or a novice diver, this hotel has some of the best scuba diving in the entire world. I went diving almost daily and they provided the best care and attention. The reefs in this area of the Maldives are truly special. Even for those who are not into scuba diving, the house reef where you can snorkel is remarkable.  For those who love the spa, let me tell you that the Six Senses spa was amazing. We went to the spa many times over and came away with the‚Ä¶"
"We had a family holiday that will stay with us for a lifetime . Six senses Laamu  is most definitely paradise , white fluffy beaches , crystal clear water and beautiful marine life but what sets this resort apart from others is the people that work there . Special mention shah our Gem who could not do enough for us and always with a smile was a true Gem , Minah who felt like a long lost friend ,the wonderful Vicki from kids club who treated my children like gold  and Jule who welcomed us into breakfast everyday and made my kids the most brilliant pancakes. You guys made the holiday more special than we could of hoped for . Thank you !!"
"Sixth sense Laamu. True paradise, made all the more special by the incredible service from Mina(guest relations manager) shah(our gem) & Vicky(kids club). What a team. OUTSTANDING!!! We‚Äôll definitely be back!!"
Wonderful experience   It was a wonderful experience which is beyond my expectations. The villa was bigger than what I saw from pictures. The amenities in the villa is perfect. Our GEM Shah made our holiday a wonderful experience. He fulfilled our requests. He explained everything in detail.   They have more than three different restaurants which we can enjoy at all times. Specially we enjoyed Leaf restaurant for dinner. Breakfast at the main restaurant was really good. Special thanks to chef Jackoline for making special pancakes for my wife.   Chill bar restaurant is a great place to enjoy lunch and dinner. They have menu with lots of options. Food in chill bar restaurant is so delicious. Thank you Adam for the great service.

"Amazing uncrowded surf with some of the best surf coaching in The Maldives. Hamish and 'Pato' gave incredible surf instruction and he was always finding the best uncrowded wave to surf.  They were not only able to provide high quality waves for my boyfriend, but also made me feel super safe and comfortable as an intermediate surfer. I feel like I improved immensely as a surfer on this trip.  Not to mention Holly and her great photos that I get to take home with me as some of the best memories of the trip.  I felt like part of the surf family and loved how they got just as excited as me when I got good waves :) I would 10/10 recommend this spot and all the amazing people at tropic surf are the reason that I will keep coming back."
"We have been to other hotels in Maldives in the past but the Six Senses Laamu is definitely second to none! Excellent staff and customer service, wonderful facilities, the best restaurants. A wonderful experience!"
"we cant put into words our days here. they were perfect family days, even our one-and-a-half-year-old son enjoyed every second. The island picnic is an incredible tour and not to be missed. A blue we've never seen before and a unique experience. The entire hotel staff is super helpful, efficient, kind and welcoming. Special thanks to our Gem Hamza who did everything to make everything come out perfect. He helped us with everything we needed and more. To Riffath who was super kind and lovingly organized our villa every day. Ibbe Front office manager, Thoir, Greg, Ansaar, Hassaan and everyone else who welcomed us with open arms. We are returning home renewed and already wanting to be back. Congratulations to the entire team for making Six Senses the best hotel! thank you for these‚Ä¶"
"I‚Äôve spent two weeks with my family in this amazing resort in the Laamu atoll, and when we wouldn‚Äôt want to go away ! The resort is stunning under every aspect, very  respectful of the nature, the island is large enough (for Maldivian standards), so every guest has his/her own bike with a personalized wooden tag to get around the different areas riding among trees. Our villa was enormous and really scenographic, with a beautiful garden and pool, facing a private beach. The house reef is fantastic , full of fishes and corals, and all around there are amazing views, sunsets, colors‚Ä¶.a bliss for body and soul! üòçüòçüòç Food was great ( I am Italian and to us food is very important ü§£‚ò∫Ô∏è), and all personnel was extra kind and helpful.

"Perfection. Every detail and anticipated need has been considered from the pick up on the boat until the departure.   It is obviously not inexpensive but it is not just worth it, it is good value for this level of venue. We have been to others, for less, and paid more but I‚Äôm sure nothing will ever surpass The Six Senses.   Highly recommend. We would love to go back and try other locations. We have also been guests in Ziggy Bay but this was the best stay of our lives."
"We would like to say thank you very much Six Senses resort for such a great stay that we have had in September 2021. Everything was perfect: eco style and design of the resort and the water villa, the beautiful reef and the nature, splendid breakfast and delicious restaurants (the Leaf is our favourite one!), the highest level of service! We were so happy to see almost every day the sea hawksbill turtles either on the reef near the Chill bar or on the right side of Jetty A during walking to our villa. The snorkelling on the house reef was so exciting and we enjoyed colourful underwater world. Also it was so cool to taste about 50 types of unusual ice-cream, which is available free of charge on the resort. The atmosphere on the resort was fantastic and really relaxing. We would‚Ä¶"
"Summary: I would give this resort 7 stars out of 5 if I could. The staff is friendly and helpful, the food is delicious, the activities are varied and plentiful, and the accommodations are immaculate. If you can make the trip then I cannot recommend it enough. This entire stay was pure magic.   Staff: After our domestic flight and short boat ride (all organized by Six Senses) we arrived to the dock to find a large group of the staff to greet us and introduce us to the island/resort. Then we were introduced to our personal GEM (Guest Experience Manager) Hamza who set up all the experiences we wanted and was in constant contact the entire stay to make sure our every need and want was catered to.

"If you are looking to a 5 starts hotel with a 10 starts service, with 3 Michelin starts like restaurants, with amazing weather, beach and views, with amazing reefs where you can snorkeling or dive next to turtles, sharks, mantas and amazing see life, do meditation and yoga, where the culture‚Äôs focus is sustainability don‚Äôt look further.. you found it!!  We had been in other six senses hotels, but this one just adds the expectations for the next ones to a higher level!  we had an amazing 7 nights at Six Senses Laamu, where our GEM ( guest experience manager) Hamzath had an incredible work of making sure we had the best experience of it all, the 25 chefs and staff where always looking forward to delight the customers in all 5 restaurants and other off restaurants experiences (‚Ä¶"
"The. Best. Hotel. Period. I have traveled quite extensively all over the world for over 40 years and the Six Senses Laamu is the best experience I have ever had. The staff are attentive and genuinely care about the guests. Every little detail has been perfected. We stayed in a Laamu Ocean villa with a pool and were in awe when the GEM (your personal assistant) dropped us off. The room is absolutely perfect. The bed very comfy, the outside shower and tub are amazing, the crows nest was very quaint and cozy, the pool so refreshing, the outside eating table was perfect for breakfast, and the ladder access to the ocean so convenient. We kept jumping in the ocean for a quick swim or snorkel, then into the pool, and then off to the outdoor shower, retuned to our books and then we‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses is the best place to have any vacation, particularly a Honeymoon, great service and activities such as free diving, snorkeling, dolphin safari, among others. But most important is the people  that work at Six Senses that make the upmost experience, everyone was perfect!"
"Everybody should get to know Six senses Laamu! It is the most beautiful place I have ever been or seen!! There is a ton of activities to do, including diving, a great variety of water sports and specially couples romantic and fun experiences! But above all, the Six Senses team is what makes this place unique! The GEMs (guest experience managers) are always with you taking care of every small detail.   Our GEM was named Shah, who made everything perfect!! More than a dedicated professional and an exmaple, Shah is now a friend!  A special thank you to Hassaan, leevan, Hafeez and Riza, the crew at sip sip bar, which is an awesome beach club! To Jailam, at Leaf, a delicious fresh restaurant!

"We had a short vacation here after much deliberation and it proved to be a hit. The service was top notch, our GEM Aslah is the best, taking care of everything for us including filling Imuga forms! Ali was very patient teaching us snorkelling and I even saw a shark near the reef. I loved tasting their icecreams during the stay and but still managed to taste only a quarter of the flavours. We interacted with Marteyne, the GM and special thanks to her for making sure our vacation is special. The island itself is beautiful with Beach Gardenia and fragrant flowers on some stretches. They are so much into conservation and sustainability that they even have their own chicken coop!   "
"I had wonderful time at laamu, from the time we arrived here we met our gem Abdulla and he escort them to the villa and making sure everything is fine and i am enjoying.   The foid was amazing, leaf is the best restaurant and at longitude breakfast was stunning, we loved it. Everyone is ready to help at always .

"Literally paradise. Abdulla was a wonderful host!  I recommend going for at least 6 nights, there are so many islands to visit and the hotel has a wonderful set up. You will never want to leave. Perfect vacation!"
"My expectation of this hotel was huge, but it surpassed expectations, simply note 1000 in everything.  Our bungalow was a dream, hospitality, exceptional food, activities, not to mention that each guest receives exclusive concierge treatment.  we were lucky to have Sha, a fantastic person who made this trip a wonderful experience for us."
"it was incredible, the service was impeccable and everyone was very attentive, especially our concierge Shah, who attended us masterfully.  All attractions were pleasant and the food was not far behind."
"The place is beautiful,  the staff are so kind and nice! Always will get you what you need. Specially our GEM Hamza was so nice and helps us with every request we had. The Surfing with Tropi Surf was amazing! Beautiful waves and the instructors Saif and Luck was really good and helped me a lot in the water.  Loved the biking around the island."
"TLDR version; So glad we picked this place over a 1000 other resorts in Maldives. Everything was perfect.  The resort is mostly about providing wonderful service in a beautiful setting with a sense of responsibility towards the eco-system.  Pre-arrival : They sent us a pre-arrival form to note all our preferences including what fragrance we wanted for our scented pillows. They promptly informed a day before our departure about our domestic transfers and everything else we needed to know.  On Arrival in Male: Once we passed immigration, Amir was waiting with a Six Senses sign for us and promptly whisked us away to a private section of the Moonima Lounge in the domestic terminal. He did the checkin for us and we never felt so relaxed in an airport. He did help us when we were‚Ä¶"

He was so nice and kind, anything we needed he was there for us, must say such a  good host. Food was too good .. There was so much for Breakfast and everything was so good and the best part of the breakfast was that you can get pancakes of any shape and any sea animal you like which was made by Rana. You can also have free ice cream as many times as you like, which are  48 flavors in total.. Our server Mahid took really good care of us. Such a nice person.

Six Senses taken care of every small detail and ensured comfortable stay all through our trip.  Our GEM Ali - the magic maker and made sure of all our requirements.  Maahid at Chill Bar picked up our food taste very quickly and arranged meals as per our taste buds.  Will be back to Six Senses for sure.
"Planning our Honeymoon during the COVID-19 times proved difficult, until I discovered the Maldives. Six Senses Maldives was highly rated, and boy did it live up to the hype. Upon arrival to the Male airport, we were immediately greeted by the Six Sense team, and assisted through all the transport process to the resort. Upon arriving at the resort and throughout our stay, the staff was helpful, friendly, and very knowledgeable about all aspects of the resort and it‚Äôs unique culture. We loved the sustainability aspect of the resort, and it wasn‚Äôt at the expense of quality or comfortability.  A few shout outs to the staff are needed, as they were amazing. Upon arrival you meet your appointed GEM (Guest Experience Maker), ours was Aslah and he was awesome. From the start I felt‚Ä¶"

Everyone is so friendly and committed to their sustainability initiative. Guests are assigned a GEM, guest experience maker, upon arrival who helps you do everything! We had Aslah - he was fantastic! So knowledgeable, easy to talk to and very nice. He had us set up with bikes (a trike for me), dinner reservations, and a list of potential activities when we arrived! He regularly checked in with us and made us feel at home. Patrick is another GEM we interacted with quite a bit - again, super easy to talk to and very helpful!

My wife and I chose to spend our honeymoon at six senses laamu and we couldn't have chosen a better place. They offered a lot of activities which made the stay an even better experience. The food and the facilities were also immaculate but the service made the stay unique. Our Gem Shah was always there when we needed something so we didnt have to worry about anything because he already took care of it. Bakka always made sure the rooms were completely tidy and he worked like a ghost because we didnt see him during our entire stay. Atheef was always very friendly at breakfast and made sure that no wish remained unfulfilled. Chef Rana made the best ice cream ever which was complementary all day. All the other staff also did a great job to make the trip even more unique. I can‚Ä¶
"We enjoyed every minute of our honeymoon at six senses. The concept of being barefeet, no need to dress up and the amazing nice stuff (Shah, Athef, Chef Rana, Bakka) creates a very relaxing and non comparable Ambiente in the still very luxurious Resort. We can also highly recommend the outstanding activities offered by the hotel, if you want to make your relaxing holiday more adventurous. We‚Äôre already looking forward coming back to this wonderful place."
"This resort is absolutely world class.  The water, the architecture, the food the service - the Dive Team.  Completely over the top.  I was afraid of diving and I loved the experience so much I actually got certified and had over 9 dives during our visit."
"The resort is beyond great and such a heavenly place. Starting from the warm welcoming, we had the six senses laamu group waiting for us and introducing us to our GEM Abdulla who we couldn‚Äôt have enjoyed and take advantage of our trip and experience without him. The place is fabulous, first we were amazed by the ‚Äòdown to earth philosophy‚Äô which stands on walking with no shoes on, the views are breathtaking and the weather was nice. Speaking of food, we tasted many cuisines, Japanese, Mediterranean, South Asian and more. Which made the experience more fun and unique. There are also many activities to do and many lifetime experiences to go for. We tried the private sunset dolphin cruise, we had the chance to catch dolphins on sunset and take pictures together, it was a fabulous‚Ä¶"
"Amazing resort! Would definitely recommend it to anyone for honeymoon! We were so amazed by the services the resort offers! Everything was on point! We were so happy and wished we could stay there longer.   Now, the thing that I want to mention is that our stay there wouldn‚Äôt be perfect without the assistance of our GEM (Guest Executive Manager) Abdulla, I guess we were so lucky to have such a kind and helpful GEM, he made sure we were having fun and enjoying our stay to the fullest, he managed our activities plan, he booked everything we wanted, he was caring and available, always giving us advices and suggestions, moreover he is a GREAT photographer!

I want to thank especially the staff at the spa and for helping me to relax and discover new ways to take care of myself, and Shyam the yoga instructor for his brilliant sessions in the morning to get me going for the day!  For nature lovers - I can't imagine there are many resorts where you can so easily snorkel with turtles, or even get to name one !

They sincerely try to do their best to make you happy, an do 200 % to make their best! From the start we got our personal manager Ainura, she arranged movies in cinema for my son, arranged dinner for him,  organized our ioleisure, even things that we didn't ask and didn't expect to get!

"If you - like we did - were looking all over tripadvisor to try and find the best place to have your honey moon. Then Six Senses Laamu Will get my highest recommendation. We were looking for a place with great snorkeling/diving opportunities, great food and relaxed atmosphere. This place fulfilled all those points to perfection. We were positively surprised by the creativity around the changing menus with well known dishes given a local touch and cooked well. The House reef is great! We Saw reef sharks, coral, manta rays and sea turtles. The dive center have very well educated divers and marine biologists who Will answer all your questions. There is plenty of things to do on the Island. For my wife‚Äôs birthday we did a private picnic to an island where it was just us for 6 hours‚Ä¶"
"There are many places you can spend your honeymoon. You should spend it here. Beautiful ocean views can be found in many places, but the level of outstanding service provided by Six Senses Laamu is absolutely unparalleled. To begin with, every guest receives their own personal ""Guest Experience Maker,"" or GEM, who is essentially a personal concierge that can arrange everything for you -- from snorkeling, to surf, to dining options, to spa bookings, and tirelessly rearranges your bookings as your preferences and priorities change during your stay.   Every member of the staff -- and I mean every member -- works tirelessly to know your name and personal preferences to make your stay as personalized and comfortable as possible. It feels more like you are being welcomed by a family‚Ä¶"
"Beautiful and well maintained hotel rooms, very friendly staff, and superior guest experience. We enjoyed every second of our stay!   Our GEM Aslah took very good care of us and accommodated all the changes we made to our schedule. Once he found out the dinner was too salty for me, he informed all the restaurants to make things less salty for me for every meal. Appreciate the personalized services! Thank you!   We also loved the SPA and was amazed by their highly skilled therapists. My massage therapist Pema gave me great recommendations and I loved all my treatments!    Thank you for everything! Best vacation ever!"
"The best place to find peace, fun and freedom. It‚Äôs a wonderful space whose philosophy respects the environment enormously.  Our Sunset water Villa pool was a fantastic haven of tranquility. We enjoyed more and better thanks to the assistance of our GEM Shah, who managed each one of our wishes during our stay, always with a big smile and magnificent willingness. With regard to smiles, a special thanks to Jackie (from Myanmar) who made us happy every morning at breakfast and Riffath who was the best organizing my villa and great and very professional person.  Everything here is perfect. Cleaning, food, design, villas, music.  Thanks to the magnificent team of this visor for the great work they do and for taking care of every detail so that all guests feel at home."
"It is hard to sum up the level of magic we experienced at Six Senses. The stunning aqua ocean views, colorful sunsets, thoughtful and calming design elements, amazing surf, relaxing spa and impeccable service. Our GEM Ainura made sure that every detail was taken into consideration to make our stay extremely  special, for me the yogi and foodie, and my husband the surfer. She recommended one of the most exciting culinary experiences with the Sommelier, Kareem, who entertained us for the night with his knowledge and passion for food and wine. We loved seeing our favorite waiter, Hassan, for our dinner at Leaf and poolside lunch at Sip Sip every day. Aimon kept our room a spotless sanctuary each day,  bringing our favorite pillows and refreshing everything we needed without us ever‚Ä¶"
"It is hard to describe an experience when so many facets of a stay have exceeded your expectations.  The Six Senses does this with aplomb. Mostly this is down to the atmosphere and service, driven by your own Guest Experience Manager and of course backed up by excellent management.  The property wows, and the way the staff make you fee wows! This is hard to pull off but they do it. The property used to be Soneva Fushi, creatively built with thousands of tonnes of Indonesian wood, the common areas feel like a large floating dock or dow.  This underpins the fact that the experience of the island is not just sitting on the beach but enjoying the various spaces, either over water, at the beach club, spa, beaches or water sports centre, or meandering between them on your bicycle. ‚Ä¶"

"I dont know where to start... Six senses Laamu is just so much more than we expected! From the moment you set foot on the transfer boat the experience begins. You arrive at a dreamy paradise with wooden overwater installations, white sand beaches and crystaline pure blue waters, its exactly how you picture paradise to be.   The over water villas are a dream! Sunbathing on our deck, just a jump from the water, snorkeling with turtles and rays every day just infront of our villa, the outdoor shower, the personalized bikes and the barefoot experience.

"We've traveled quite a bit throughout the whole world and we've stayed in some of the nicest hotels you can imgine, however none of them are even close to leave in our memories a feeling like the one we have from Six Senses Laamu. There are no words able to describe how amazing are the installations (super recommended to do the sustainability tour in which they transparently show you the ""behind the scenes"" of how they make your dreams come true), but even less I can describe how friendly, kind and close the staff is (they felt almost as friends after some few days). I know that it's not fair to mention only some of them, because each member of the staff is there to contribute to your pleasant stay, but I feel the need to specially thank Mahid and Maduk from the Chill bar, for‚Ä¶"
"What a wonderful experience!!!!   We were lucky enough to have Abdulla as our GEM (Guest Experience Manager), he was pure joy and helped make our honeymoon perfect. The vibe of the resort is laid back luxury. Bare feet are encouraged, as are a fun and relaxed atmosphere. All the staff seem to get along which is something that is so lovely to be around.   The culture feels accepting with a focus on sustainability and wellbeing. Make no mistake, you will feel like you‚Äôre in paradise and complete luxury, but you won‚Äôt feel guilty about damaging our beautiful planet. Every care is taken to inform and the resort takes impeccable care of the island and celebrates its fruits!!

"The hotel was beautiful, clean and the food great. We had a fabulous time and were sorry to leave. Our room was clean and was kept in a very good condition throughout our stay. The resort offers so many activities, Snorkeling was OK but no many fish. our GEM was very helpful arranging everything. thankyou so much Reaching the island is not convenient but once you reach its true paradise."
"Six Senses Laamu exceeded all our (already high) expectations!!   Our GEM Afrah was the best, most attentious and careful friend we could ask for in this trip!   All the restaurants in the Hotel were amazing (specially LEAF)!"
Six senses was a great experience. Best times of my life. This place has a great energy ideal to relax and be with your loved ones. Our gem was great. Afrah was always there for us a great friend that schedule everything so we can enjoy this little heaven in earth
"This was my second time at Six Senses Laamu. The atmosphere in this place is unbelievable. The care for the nature, the feeling of being welcome, the staff always with a smile and super available to accommodate your every whim. The quality of the food is really unparalleled, top notch, but without being pretentious.  And the Spa‚Ä¶. Heaven. It is really a treat for the six senses.  Love it and plan to go back. Amazing."
"Our expectations were very high going into our time at Six Senses Laamu given we have been to other Six Senses before....  our expectations were exceeded over and over again.  The villa, food, classes, diving/snorkeling, and hospitality were all beyond what we could have hoped for.  Special thanks to our GEM (Ali) for always being one step ahead of all of our requests.  We cannot wait to go back."
"Six senses Laamu was an absolute dream come true. It exceeded our expectations. Our GEM took pristine care of us, making the arrival and departure so smooth, but also ensuring we had the best dinner reservations planned, dolphin and snorkeling cruises booked, spa services, among many other things that we didn‚Äôt have to worry about. The dining options are fantastic, ranging from Mediterranean to Japanese fusion and Sip Sip was our favorite place for lunch with the best waiters  (Leevaan, Jailam, Riza, Bala). Do not hesitate on booking this place for your honeymoon!"
"From the moment we were picked up for the boat ride over to the resort, Six Senses was above and beyond what we had hoped for. Everything is meticulously thought out, and created an unforgettable honeymoon. We never wanted to leave, and will certainly be back! Our GEM, Aslah was amazing, and always made sure we were scheduling everything we wanted to do. The restaurants, and excursions were all incredible. Special shout-out to our housekeeper, Ihsaan, as well as all of the hosts (especially Leevaan, Jailam, and Riza).

"This resort is incredible.  From the moment you step on the boat, the staff make you feel special.  The over water villas are the stuff of dreams, and the staff make you feel like nothing is impossible.  Our ""Guest Experience Maker"" (GEM) is a true gem, and made every request possible with a wave of his magic wand... we are hiring a GEM for ourselves when we get home!    I'd like to make a quick shout out to everyone that took the time and effort to remember our names for the duration of our stay, after each first brief encounter.    Thank you so much Aslah, our GEM, and Afrah his stand-in when he was on his day off.  Thank you to Mahid for always keeping our drinks full... you were our first ""friend"" at Six Senses!  Thank you to Naail for your amazing fine dining service and‚Ä¶"
"What can I say, I never stopped smiling the whole time we have been here.  The resort is gorgeous, the sustainability aspect is perfect!  The staff are amazing.  Every detail is thought about and they make your wishes come true.  A few shoutouts to some of the amazing staff who made our stay here special: Aslah, you are a true GEM and made us feel pampered, yet at home.  Mahid, you were our first friend after Aslah and kept our cups full!  Saudhoon, you kept our room beautifully clean (which we acknowledge wasn't easy) and loved your kind nature.  Naail, your service at the Leaf was impeccable and we loved seeing you at breaky in the morning.  Tropic Surf Team!!!  Thank you sooo much for getting me into some of the most amazing and challenging waves, including my first clean‚Ä¶"
"Had the most AMAZING week in an Ocean Villa, primarily diving and completing our AOWD and OWD courses, my husband and I.  From the time we set foot in Male and back the entire team of Six Senses take amazing pride in looking after you. From Shaania at the reservations, to Shah our guest experience maker, and Haisham & Nik from the Deep Blue Divers, ensured that we enjoyed every bit of time that we spent at the resort. Special mention goes to Santosh and Manoj from the Culinary team who went out of their way to make specials for us with Mahit taking good care of us at the chill bar. Friday night Asian buffet was the highlight of our culinary experience, with special biryani and fish fry for us. And the choicest of ice-creams and sorbets next to the dive centre and we didn‚Äôt miss‚Ä¶"
"We are just finishing up our first trip to the Maldives and are so glad that we picked Six Senses Laamu for our stay.   Once landing in Male, you will take a small flight into the local airport and then a 15 min speedboat ride will get you to the resort. Once there, we were greeted by the whole team and after a short welcome was introduced to Shah our GEM, who along with Ainura were wonderful in every aspect. Shah would check in with us multiple times a day and would make sure that our stay was most memorable. For example, it was my husbands birthday during this stay, and he helped plan a surprise massage for us that day as well as cake for our dinner. When my husband mentioned that he gets sea sick, Shah made sure that the we had a more stable boat for our dolphin cruise.  When‚Ä¶"
"We stayed for 5 nights for our Honeymoon, and we couldn't have asked for anything better! From the moment we were met on the Island by the entire resort team, we were made to feel special and well and truly looked after. The accommodation was first class, with our over water villa boasting a spacious bed/living area, outside dining and relaxing area (beds and hammocks), a top deck which was perfect for turtle and sunset watching, and the highlight, an outdoor bathing/shower area with a fabulous seethru bath with views across the lagoon - simply divine! The dining options were plentiful, with 5 restaurants. The food was 5star standard, and the breakfast options were immense (my favourite being the animal shaped pancakes). A special mention to Leaf restaurant, which was easily one‚Ä¶"
"Our family and I had the most incredible experience at Six Senses. We completed our PADI OPEN WATER 1 diving course with Nick. Nick was not only an amazing dive instructor but he made the experience so much fun too! We saw amazing marine life and it was a highlight of my trip. Six Senses offers great surfing too. Saif from the surf center was a kind, patient instructor who made the whole experience one that I will never forget."
"My family and I have just enjoyed a heavenly 9 day holiday at the beautiful Six Senses Laamu.   From the moment we arrived we knew we were in for something special! The resort is spectacular, it occupies its own island and everyone rides around on personalized bicycles which immediately makes you feel on holiday! We stayed in an over water Villa facing the sunset which was truly magical because along with the sunset we got the luxury of snorkeling on the house reef where we saw incredible marine life including Lumi, the friendliest turtle. It is not just the pristine setting or the incredible marine life that makes it so special, what sets it apart is the quality of the incredible team who make you feel at home and special from the minute you arrive. Hats off to the management‚Ä¶"
"We stayed in a sunrise water villa facing the seagrass between jetty A and B. We saw green sea turtles, hawksbeaks, eagle rays and stingrays swim right under us. We also snorkeled the house reef. I‚Äôve never seen so many colorful fish in my entire life and the reef is only 5 meters away from the chill bar. Service was excellent. All the staff were professional and charming. The pastry chef/ice cream wizard was especially friendly and skillful(ask for pancake shapes). All the Marine biologists were amazing and the dolphin cruise with them was a trip highlight (make sure you check out their lectures on seagrass and Maldivian culture). Will definitely be coming back :D"
"Six Senses Laamu exceeded all of our expectations. We stayed at the water villa and it was amazing. All of the staff was so kind, friendly and helpful, especially the pastry chef and the lady at the Ice Bar. The food here is amazing and they have the most amazing ice cream (and it‚Äôs complimentary!). We will definitively come back to this beautiful resort."
"After hours researching Maldives resorts for our special occasion, we settled on Six Senses Laamu.  What a great decision that was‚Ä¶  We arrived by boat to the stunning island and were greeted by the VERY friendly Laamu staff and our Guest Experience Maker (GEM), Ainura.  Ainura was extremely helpful and made our occasion much more special, thank you again!    There‚Äôs too many good things to mention but here are some highlights: beautifully designed villas with a unique natural style, picturesque views everywhere you go, extensive list of activities from guided snorkelling to a sunset dolphin cruise, incredibly dense sea life, barefoot concept for true island living, sustainable approach with recycling and growing their own fresh produce, delicious food with daily changing menus,‚Ä¶"
"My husband and I and 3 children (ages 15,13 and 12)have been fortunate enough to have travelled to some beautiful places over the years  but we all agree that this holiday at Six Senses Laamu in Maldives has hands down been the best ever! The island is insanely beautiful. A winning combination of aqua water, the softest white sand, vivid green jungle and over water villas, beach villas and main restaurant eating areas which all sensitively blend into the environment creating a soft and beautiful tropical island/beach-chic landscape.   But what truly sets the Six Senses apart other than it‚Äôs pristine location and beautiful setting is the quality of the incredible team that looks after you during your stay. We were greeted on arrival by Abdulla our GEM (who really is a gem!) who‚Ä¶"
"The vibe is amazing. You won't find better service anywhere. Everyone is just so friendly & genuine, you end up knowing everyone by name by the end of the trip.  We had our 3 year old daughter with us & everyone was super nice to her. They kept on giving her little gifts here & there. She is a picky eater & they kept on trying different recipes for her. She loved the kids club & couldn't wait to go & hang out with Zahi, Vicky & Nelha. She had the time of her life!  Food was also incredible! Every restaurant was very tasty & different. They have Asian street markets & Mediterranean nights that are great. The sushi restaurant Zen is world class. Also we tried the chili table for dinner one night. If you can handle spicy, it's a must!  The spa & wellness center was great, I was‚Ä¶"
"Had the pleasure to visit Six Senses Laamu several times in the past. Each visit the entire team manages to step it up even further and make the stay more memorable. There are too many employees to highlight, the whole team is amazing, true hospitality professionals. The PADI dive center ‚ÄúDeep Blue Divers‚Äù does an awesome job, did a total of eight dives during my stay, one better than the other. Everything the Laamu Atoll has to offer underwater is just mind blowing, we had big fish, colorful reef fish and healthy coral reefs.  Thanks to each an everyone at Six Senses Laamu for the amazing week, and thanks a million for making my life a milestone richer!"
"Several times have been to Maldives, but will admit that the Six Senses is an exceptional- personal approach, outstanding service and stunning  staff. Here would like to highlight chef Stefan who prepared absolutely delicious food based on my requests, Patrick who made sure that everything was perfect throughout the holiday. Ainura, who made us feel special, she was always there to fulfill our requests and even had arranged surprise private cinema for us. Restaurant personals, manager-Nasru, Levan, Shah and Kattu.  Everything can be found on a small paradise, snorkeling, diving, surfing, delicious food, private cinema at the beach, beautiful views, sunset.   Nothing to complain, everything was amazing and perfect. I will definitely recommend Six Senses.  Planning to come back‚Ä¶"
The resort is marvelous  Mr.Shah the GEM was excellent care giver  Activities were interesting and fulfilling our expectations  The service was great  Manpower were great and very polite and helpful  Restaurants were good quality and satisfactory  Water Villa with pool is my recommendation  I would strongly recommend this resort with no hesitation
"Among the SIX we have managed to get closer to the sky: the two of us, the landscape, the sea, the resort and our magnificent GEM Ainura.  We were surprised by the friendliness and affectionate treatment of Nasru, restuarant manager.  The professionalism and ""finezza"" of Karim, the sommelier who provided us with an evening of ""great reserve"".  We had the opportunity to enjoy both a ""water villa"" and a ""beach villa"", both fulfilled our expectations of the comfort and style characteristic of the company SIX SENSES.  Starting with breakfast in the villa that Ibrahim, our room boy, served us, was a good start to a day in heaven.  We enjoyed each and every meal we had at the resort.  Highly recommended the bbq at the sanbank.  SIX SENSES allowed us to make our dream come true in‚Ä¶"
"My husband and I traveled to Six Senses for our honeymoon for a 8 night 9 day stay.  Everything about our experience from start to finish was incredible.  The hospitality of staff, quality of food, beautiful accommodations and gorgeous property made our trip absolutely perfect.    Our expectations were definitely exceeded from the moment we stepped off the speed boat.  All of the staff was so welcoming and friendly and made us feel right at home.  We greatly appreciated that we were assigned a GEM (Guest Experience Maker) who was our point person for all things.  Afrah, was attentive to our needs and interests and did everything to make our trip memorable by booking our excursions, making restaurant reservations and answering all our questions.   My husband and I decided to‚Ä¶"
"My family and I travel often, on some interesting trips.  Six senses Laamu exceeded our expectations, Far from the stereotype where you just go on vacation and learn nothing. This is a well thought concept where guests immediately fit into the spirit of the island. What makes this place special are the people.  Every day there is something interesting to see . There is no better way to get around  island than to ride a bicycle barefoot, then you visit each part of it several times, literally an ingenious experience. If you travel with small children, you will love Vicky and  the Kids Club. far from a boring place where children are just being cared for a while when parents are enjoying themselves.

"Amazing place and staff. Everything absolutly great. Kids club incredible, Vicky does an excelent job there. Alex, our GEM fantastic. It was also really good the Junior Biology program, Pipa is great! . Restaurants amazing. It is indeed a fabolous place for a family holiday. We will for sure repeat. Congratulations for the great and lovely staff. I've only mentioned a few, but they are all fantastic."
"So lucky to celebrate our 25th anniversary at the Six Senses Laamu! Our accommodations were great - I never tired of watching the turtles snack right off the deck of our over the water villa! Our GEM Shah was so helpful! Booking us dinners, answering all our questions and even bringing me photos of a bird I could hear but had not seen! Above and beyond! All the restaurants were exceptional especially the creative LEAF utilizing fresh herbs from the garden on property.  We loved being part of an environmentally conscience organization - riding our bikes down the jetty to restaurants or our daily activities. We were focused on diving and everyone in the on property dive shop, Deep Blue Divers, were professional, knowledgeable and fun.  Izaaz escorted us on most of our dives and we‚Ä¶"
"Very special experience overall, from the activities to the dining to the infrastructure. We chose the property partly due to its diving and partly due to its commitment to sustainability.  Six Senses delivered on both, exceeding expectations on both counts. The diving focuses on the 50 plus sites in the atoll, including great channel dives.  We saw two mantas during our visit, and so much more, from turtles to  several types of sharks. The dive center, managed by Sasha, is one of the best run we have experienced globally.  Great dive masters, including Izaaz, Danny and Stephen and helpful boat crews.  Also, a big plus is the fact that they have marine biologist on property, as we all as a project manager for the Manta Trust, Jas Corbett.  They are very informative and make the‚Ä¶"
"This hotel is beyond amazing! We stayed at the villa with sunset view and it was breathtaking!  The staff was amazing specially our GEM, Ainura! :D There is nothing bad to say from this hotel.  The food exceeded our expectations!  The Experiences that this hotel offer are top notch! We did the private island picnic (I would say is a MUST!) and the champagne pairing dinner which was exquisite!   Thanks to all the staff for making our stay a memorable one!"
"We had a wonderful time at the Resort. The service was great. There is always someone around who can help with anything. Especially our GEM Shah. He infected us with his good mood and immediately took care of our wishes.  My Balancing Thai Therapy with Napath was also an experience, as well as the Crystal Singing Ball Meditation. My kids loved diving and surfing very much."
"A beautiful resort with caring staff. Our guest experience maker, shah, did a great job. He organized everything throughout our stay and was very helpful and kind.  The food was delicious and offers a lot of variation as the menu changes every day.  One of the best activities was surfing, but it is very wether dependent and therefore may not be possible everyday.  Overall, the stay at Six Senses Laamu was a great experience. We look forward to our next visit."
"Such a nice place to visit!! Super experience! The staff there is amazing, expecially the dj who transmits such a good vibe, loved that guy! 100% recommended. You should go there and meet this place and there people!"
"We had an upgrade to a lagoon view overwater bungalow, beautifully decorated, provides perfect stting for a relaxing vacation. We were assigned Ainura as our GEM (Guest Experience Maker), she really made all the efforts to make our vacation memorable, As an example, since one our daughters has problems in the ears that require the ears to be dry, we googled to find a snorkel mask that would solve the issue, and Ainura looked for this item in Male, found exactly the model we have provided, and got the mask in the resort in less than 24 hours. mDinig options were great, half board allowed to dine in every restaurant, Sip Sip for lunch and Leaf for dinner were usually our options. Experiences also great, would recommend scubadiving and snorkeling with resort marine biologists.‚Ä¶"
"After being three times to the Maledives in different resorts - I want to say Six Senses Laamu is by far the best place we have been. The food, the villa, the entire service is absolutely superior ! I need to mention the Yoga and breathing classes which literally changed my life. Special thanks to Hemant, who is a brilliant teacher. Finally, I want to mention the Spa, the massage treatment made me pain free and helped me to regain my mental and physical health - it was just an amazing experience. In this context I need to mention Shyam as an absolute phantastic therapist. Six Senses Laamu is our favourite vacation spot - we will come back again soon !"
Best vacation in life! Thank you for all especially Hamzath! You made all our dreams come true!!! The whole team is amazing! I have no words to describe only really wants to thank you all! Hope to see you again next year!!! Obrigada!
"Six Senses was a wonderful place to stay in the Maldives. The staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming, making us feel at home and relaxed while still living ""the good life"" for our entire stay. The food and drinks are fantastic as well. We enjoyed snorkeling right off the dock every day with wonderful Marine guides who answered every fish-related question we could think of. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a special vacation."
"It was an amazing experience!!! We enjoyed every minute in Six senses and for sure we ll came back very soon! Everything was perfect, food, drink, surf and the people here are so nice and helpful!  Edith, Karim, Holly, Hamish, Saif, Mario and all staff thank you so much!"
"This is our third stay at Six Senses Laamu, and it has truly become our paradise home. We have come here since 2017, and each time is an absolute dream. The staff is extremely friendly and service minded, and we love the fact that most of them are from the nearby islands. We love this place so much that we brought both mine and my wifes families with us this time. Needless to say they were all blown away.   The snorkeling is amazing around the house reef, and its well worth going out on a boat to snorkle at the reefs nearby as well. We‚Äôve seen sharks, rays, turtles and much more exciting marine life.  Food is 5/5 as well, and we love their buffet nights the most. The ice cream bar is filled with delicious flavors that both children and adults will love, and the best part is that‚Ä¶"
"Very nice resort, we had so much fun and were treated so well. Hace to remark that the dj was amazing, making the evenings so relaxing with very nice vibes. Cosmic experience! Will surely come back ti repet!"
"Right off the bat, this resort did an amazing job at communicating with you and resolving any doubts/issues. They took charge to make sure that you made it to the island just fine and had everything ready. Our GEM Shifu was so great at helping us out throughout our stay! She took care of all of the planning/booking and made sure we didn‚Äôt have to worry about a thing. Thank you shifu!!  Amazing resort with amazing views and activities. Food was excellent. You will not regret it."
"Hamza is very attentive, polite, always present, always smiling.  He gave us a great guest experience at Six sense.  He offered us good suggestions for activities.  His pro-activity made our days more relaxed to enjoy the rest.  He did an excellent job!"
"We are just back from an amazing 14 days holiday. It is hard to write a review as everything was perfect.  Villa: we were a family of three with a 15yr old. We started with two nights in a family beach villa ocean side which was fantastic. More privacy as the children room is separate. Very private. We then switched to a sunset laamu pool water villa. We had the one at the end of jetty a and I don‚Äôt think you can find a better view! We snorkelled to the reef every day. We also saw turtles, rays and sharks between jetty a and b. Just amazing. We loved our villa. Food and diversity was fantastic  Diving. We are all divers and we had one of our best dives experience thanks to the great team. Special thanks to Dottie who guided my daughter through the advance course. We did two‚Ä¶"
"Recently, my family and I stayed here for an almost month-long vacation to celebrate my mom's birthday, and I can definitely say it was an excellent vacation in every way.  We all had absolutely nothing to complain about. Our villa was perfect. It had enough storage for all our belongings, had a very nice view, and was close to all the restaurants and everything else. Our villa attendant also made sure we had fresh ice cubes in our room every day, something we very much appreciated!  The food everywhere was excellent, no matter where we ate (I can't even choose a favourite place, the food was excellent everywhere). Big thanks to Chef Stefan and his team! And of course, we loved the massive selection of free ice cream and sorbets, we miss them so much already!  Our GEMs, Edith‚Ä¶"
What an Experience! The best Hotel I visited so far. Relaxed barefoot experience and Culinary Journey through asia. Our gem Aslah was ingenious - we felt like kings here. Kids Club is a blessing - they even bring your kid home after. Perfect!

"Where to begin. There‚Äôs a million reasons I could give for why you should visit Six Senses, the wonderful accommodations, world class dining, jaw-dropping ocean views, crystal clear waters and white sand beaches, the sustainability and environmental initiatives that really set it apart and much MUCH more. But where the resort really shines is the unmatched service and attention from every single one of the staff. From the moment we landed and were introduced to each staff member personally we knew this was going to be something different. We met Shah, our G.E.M or guest experience manager who went above and beyond in every which way to ensure our experience was just perfect. And to that end he completely delivered, arranging dinners, excursions, and giving us personal‚Ä¶"
"We spend 8 days in Six Senses hotel in Laamu, and I just can say that its a must have experience. The nature surrounding the hotel is exceptional (a tropical island with paradisiacal beaches), the environment is ecological and self-sustainable and the staff is exceptional. All this makes it a peaceful and relaxing experience, which after two years of pandemic I needed a lot. Many thanks specifically to Shah, our GYM, and Nick, the diving instructor who encouraged us to get into diving (100% recommended, we saw everything from fish to turtles, manta rays and sharks). Thanks for making the experience one of the bests of my life!  The only bad thing? Water activities are a bit overpriced."
"Breathtakingly beautiful resort with amazing staff!! I would highly recommend some of the extra experiences... totally worth it. The suken table dinner & the deserted island were beyond romantic. We also did the ""wine around the world dinner"" & Karim was our wine guru who created an amazing experience & perfectly paired our meal!   I would also recommend taking the sustainability tour with Adam the sustainability manager (complimentary). We learn so much about the efforts Six Sense resorts are making to help our planet & our future that I will go out of my way to stay at another Six Sense resort (21 in total).   Speaking of complimentary, there is free ice cream all day & Ranaa is the ice cream chef that also happens to be an excellent pancake artist!! Levan was our excellent‚Ä¶"
"We knew Maldives would be a dream come true for its crystal blue waters & our amazing water villa accommodations, what we did not expect was to be so blown away by the staff!! Every member of Six Sense Laamu is so genuinely passionate about what they do.   Everyone on staff was wonderful but there were a few that truly stood out.   Fiona & Patrick the resort managers were very attentive to details & always checking in with us. Jas & Ali were the marine biologist that we‚Äôre so knowledgeable & made our dolphin cruise & snorkeling adventures extremely memorable. The food, OMG SO GOOD!! Hats off to Chef Stefan & his staff for their creativity, presentation, & exquisite flavors!! To our favorite server Ziyan, who was so attentive & yet so cool!! Last but definitely not least, the guy‚Ä¶"
"A recent two week stay left me eager to book my next trip here. Shah, my GEM, made sure I was well looked after and scheduled my daily activities. Request him. He‚Äôs a star. The dive team- Patrick, Sasha and Haisham- were terrific and eager to plan night dives, course training etc. the surf team was what you‚Äôd expect from Tropicsurf. Everyone ‚Äòcommutes‚Äô on bikes and has a smile. It‚Äôs is like a village in a fairytale movie. Oh, and the food is great and chef Stephane will do just about anything to get dishes to your preferred taste."
"I have just returned from a 6 night stay with my family and it was absolutely amazing. The staff are all lovely, everyone from the gardeners, waiters, housekeeping and of course, management, are delightful. We travelled with two young children and it was paradise for them, playing barefoot and being in direct contact with nature was an unforgettable experience for them. Special mention to the person who makes the pancakes at breakfast every morning, as my children asked him for a different animal every day and with a smile, he always made real works of art. Of course, to our GEM Alex, charming, very attentive and always helping us to make our stay a truly #outoftheordinary experience.

"We have received the highest levels of customer service that we have experienced amongst all places we have been. Information was accurate, responses to queries were turned around very fast. The foods were DELICIOUS. Cannot have enough from what ever I had. Always wanted more. üòÖ  Definitely visiting for more.   Overall we had a very wonderful experience. Every staff member we encountered were super professional and friendly. We would like to highlight Shah from GEM and Shaniya from reservation for their kind and wonderful service. They were super friendly and made us felt like home. We were more than comfortable. They made things easier for us and really appreciate all the help. Thank you both a lot."
"We had a great experience since the begining untill the last day. The quality and details on decoration and sorroundings is excellent. The food is another level quality and there is a great variety of chooices. The staff attended us so well always, great attention, helpfull and looking to make sure we were having a great stay. Sha, our GEM, was allways there for us, he booked different restaurant choices and booked activites for us to make sure we made the most of our stay and enjoyed the hotel and Island at the most."
"My family and I began this mini vacation to six senses Laamu.   Shaaniya from reservation booked us a beach villa because we have a one year old son. I must say that this villa is the best option for us because we love the sound of nature. We could hear the waves at night.   The housekeeper of the villa made sure that our room didn‚Äôt lack anything and kept it so clean and tidy all the time.   Shah, Our butler was immensely helpful. Especially as a family with a one year old he made sure it was easy for us to go for meals and checked up on everything from meal timings to our everyday stay. He always had a bright smile and was kind every moment he spoke.   The 3 day vacation was so beautiful mainly because everything was so well organized and coordinated with us.   I‚Äôve travelled‚Ä¶"
"I have just visited Six Senses Laamu again and it was - once again, a great experience.  Before we came we had doubts whether the Maldives and Six Senses was a children's place, but it was for sure put to shame and the family‚Äôs 10 years old, Liva, loved everything and the staff were so service-minded and so much at child height, from arranging movie nights, yoga to surfing. Especially our GEM Shah which the whole family loved. We could not have had a better service, he solved everything quickly and assisted us in every possible way during our stay.   For the whole family, this stay was completely complete and we can only give the best recommendations."
"We have traveled the world and been to most places. A lot of have provided great service but this place is not only serviceminded. I is every single person, sincerely interested in giving their guests a great experience. Whether it is with a funny remark, their way of make things happen fast or the kindness. What makes Six Senses a unique guest experience is their true way of being.  They focus on children and their needs as well as they create relationships between the childern despite the language barrier.  Shah, our gem har been outstanding from the moment we entreret the ressort. He spoke with liva at eye level and she loved him from day one. He made henna on her and made a real effort to make sure she had the best experience, which of course she had. And liva and the other‚Ä¶"

I really loved the programs that they had on the sea meadows and the sustainability on their island and the community around it - thank you Pip and Adam for your positive impact!  The GEM - Aslah was very kind and professional if someone has a six sense - it‚Äôs him, he new what we needed and wanted in advance - thank you!"

"I can‚Äôt say enough what a beautiful and refreshing vacation we just had at Six Senses Laamu in Maldives. Before we left I was already calculating how we would be coming back. From the moment we arrived in Maldives airport we were never alone and without the guidance of a dedicated staff from the resort. They took care of our luggage, tagging, covid testing QR code‚Äôs, ticketing and guided us the entire way to and from, both upon arrival and departure. They were like guardian angels. If there was an earlier flight to be taken we were even given that option. We were given a to go box with our favorite snacks when going home since the boat ride back was earlier than breakfast started.   There are daily activities one can choose from or not at all. We did the group snorkeling and saw‚Ä¶"

Apart from their natural kindness, you notice an excellent training and attention to details that allow guests to enjoy their vacation to the fullest. Everything is made to enhance the guests‚Äô experience and avoid any trouble for the guests. Food is very good, with excellent ingredients and very good techniques. The sustainability concern can be seen in every detail. Aslam, our GEM was not only very nice, but the perfect mix of discretion and efficiency. He anticipated all our needs.

While I shared amazing surf spots only with friends guided by very helpful staff, my wife could use different spa treatments with specialists! The top of the experience, the food is fantastic! I hope to come back as soon as possible!"
"Six Senses Laamu is a dream come true, I shed a tear or two when we left :D. The staff makes you feel at home since the very first moment you set foot in Male and goes above and beyond to make your stay comfortable and unforgettable. Our GEM Alex, was always ahead of the curve and made our experience seamless and absolutely perfect- thank you so much Alex! As a recurring customer, it is incredible to see how throughout the years the identity of Six Senses Laamu remains intact and the values continue to come to life as they are embodied by the amazing staff of the resort.  Upon arrival to the resort you are immediately mesmerized by the place- how is this real?! Everything from the different shades of blue of the crystal clear water, the rich marine life, the vegetation that‚Ä¶"
"Six senses Laamu is the number one place to stay. Alex, our GEM, was the best and made everything fantastic. From planning out my birthday and also my bro in-laws. Also, shout out to CJ, Leevan, Alvina, Rana, Zian, Saga, Fiona, Stefan, Naif, and Adam for making our stay fabulous. I want to thank all the staff that provided the best service with our room and upkeep of the resort. This experience has made me start looking into staying at other six senses locations because of their attention to detail and spectacle custom service."
"You have to feel it yourself  You have to see it with your own eyes  You have to listen to the sounds and the silence with your own ears  You have to taste it with your own tongue  You have to smell all the beauty with your own nose  Like this you soak it all in, become one with nature in the here and now  @sixsenseslaamu is beyond what words can barely describe   It is truly home away from home. With the first step onto the island you can feel the magic. Food, service, atmosphere are outstanding with the love of details and the perfect place to be if you are looking for surfing with several surf spots right in front of your villa."
"we came to six sense laamu to enjoy our 2nd wedding anniversary, first time in the maldives and everything was enchanting! upon arrival we were amazed by the color of the water (quite different from Brazil). We met Shah special person (menager) who was responsible for introducing us to the island and scheduling our stay. we did different programs throughout our stay, from outdoor movies, dinner to special foods, see different species of fish, massage workshops, even swimming with turtles and stingrays. Paradisiacal place that needs no comment on beauty, the six seens lamuu as a hotel is fantastic as it is concerned with all nature it has its own water production as well as people who work there are also special like Riffath who organized all the things in the room (on the‚Ä¶"
"The choice of six senses had help from our agency in Brazil, the travel hunter, as every choice they direct was perfect to celebrate our wedding anniversary! six senses laamu is not simply a hotel, I have never seen a staff so concerned with the details and well-being of their guests, every day and everyone always greets you with a smile on their face and words of affection! our gem Shah I have no words to describe ,he took care of every detail of the special date of our wedding and our entire schedule with great care and delicacy! We love the riffath service in taking care of our village and always paying attention to everything we needed. The hotel presented us with fantastic massages, the unforgettable villa and all the amazing restaurants with Honorable mention to Leaf and‚Ä¶"
Paradise absolutely worthwhile to come to Six senses Laamu. Such a great relaxt admosphere with excellent service and food. Never have the feeling that it is crowded and very personal. Diving snorkeling and surfing where great experiences. Special to have this all together.
"This trip was just amazing. The resort and the island are fantastic but what really stands out is the team. They are all so genuinely nice that they made our visit so much more special. Mina, Edith, Ganesh and everyone else made us feel like we were home. Will definitely come back!"
"My husband and I visited Six Senses for our honeymoon and it was everything we dreamed of and more. From start to finish everything was absolute perfection. Every member of the staff was incredibly kind, helpful, and welcoming. Our GEM, Alex, went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our stay by making reservations for us for everything from dinners to massages and even a last minute Covid test. Nothing was too much to ask for with Alex, and it was very clear that she really enjoys her job and helping her guests enjoy their experience. The resort itself is truly the most beautiful, unique destination I‚Äôve ever been to. The architecture and design of the resort is so well thought out and unique, we were in awe of every new surprise we encountered while exploring everything it‚Ä¶"
"Six months later, here we are again in Laamu, and the curious thing is that I will return as soon as possible, because it is a place where we feel happy and cherished by people and nature.  It's an absolutely amazing experience everytime we come to SS Laamu, and we left the island with things to do. The hardest thing when we go to laamu is returning home and putting on your shoes again. Thanks again Marteyne, Mina, Edith, Nasru, Ganesh and so many others or everyone else, you guys are amazing."
"Absolutely unforgettable experience! From the setting, the villas, the friendly staff, the outstanding service all around and the freshly prepared delicious food, this must rate as on of my ultimate holidays with my family and friends. There are plenty of activities run by professionals, a large offering of different foods and cuisines prepared by world class chefs and of course the friendly and efficient service of all the staff. Our GEM, Ravah, looked after us and ensured that we were always happy and enjoying ourselves. Whether we were relaxing, involved in sporting activities or eating our meals, the staff always made ensured that it was world class"
"Six senses never fails to impress us.  The resort is so connected with nature and very quickly makes you as part of it. The people, the food, the wine , the location, the marine life and soo many things.  We loved the food at The Leaf, The Chill Bar, the food nights on longitude..   The Channel Dive and surfing sessions were soo awesome.  Kids activities in Den: Vicky, Nahla and Zahy were soo awesome and engaging with my daughter.. she loved them  Afaz and Jazz - Marine biologists went snorkeling with us which was super cool and they are so knowledgeable.  Mahi and Leevan, they mostly served us at the restaurants and got us everything we wanted even outside the menu with a great smile and yes can do attitude.. super cool!!   Finally Tohhir, our Guest Experience Manager, he was‚Ä¶"
"We were extremely fortunate and blessed to come to Six Senses Laamu for our honeymoon!  From the minute we boarded the boat for the island resort, it was encouraged to remove our shoes, and we immediately connected with nature, remaining barefoot throughout our stay.  In between the immaculately wood planked and floors, our toes were hugged by white sand, turquoise waters. We learned that the Six Senses philosophy was to help nourish and recharge not only our bodies but our mental health and spirit.  The little things were made important, our experience directed by our amazing guest manager Alex.   Our bodies were nourished by delicious food and drink infused by a lush organic garden on site and seafood caught by local fishermen, coconut ceviches, sourdough pizzas and spicy‚Ä¶"
"From day one you are treated like a friend rather than a client. The treatment between guest and stuf is therefore very close increasing the enjoyment of the trip. In addition, you have a GEM (Guest Experience Maker) that in our case was called Alex, kisses for her, who will always be willing to help you with a smile. As for the rest a ten, incredible fauna and flora and a lot of activities to perform :))"
"Everything was amazing during our stay, we had a great experience in Six Senses. Mina the Executive Manager was so helpful since we came to the resort. Ali our GEM, he was great, he was with us since day one. We really had a great time in our villa, hopefully we will be back again soon ü•∞"
"What is the best here is natural environment in everything, everywhere,  The staff are so friendly & helpful especially Mina and gem Ali.  The food is so delicious, and what a plate we want they did for us  The service Second to none  I will be back."
"We went to Six Senses Laamu for our honeymoon. We were originally supposed to spend 8 nights there and 3 nights in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka became impossible because of Covid-19 so we spent all 11 nights at Six Senses Laamu. As an IHG Spire Elite, I came across this hotel when IHG acquired Six Senses. In my 10-15 years of traveling consistently for pleasure and business, I have never experienced anything like Six Senses Laamu. It all started with our GEM (Guest Experience Manager), Aslah. He was essentially our personal assistant and took care of literally anything we needed. Spa appointment, sign up for an activity, dinner reservation, etc. He did it all. His service was second to nobody. And on top of that, he was an absolute pleasure to be around and talk to. We learned several‚Ä¶"
"We spent 11 nights at the Six Senses Laamu for our honeymoon. The resort is so beautiful, the staff is above and beyond, and the food was so delicious. I fear my review will not do this amazing place justice, but I will try to articulate our experience for future travelers to the Maldives.  I think it‚Äôs important to note that Six Senses operates with an environment first approach, but do not mistake this for a lack of luxury. The inclusion of local products and the sustainability focus gives it an organic feel in the most beautiful and romantic way. The villas are spacious and luxurious with all of the amenities you could need or want. They even offer a pillow menu for your comfort- we tried a few different pillows and aromatherapy scents for the room and loved it. You wouldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶"
"We spent six days, too short... We booked a villa for three people, it was very well equipped, very comfortable and with unbeatable views. We were assisted by Six Senses personnel from the arrival at MALE airport and also during the return trip, who took care of the checkin in the local flights, our luggage and transportation in speedboat from the local airport of Kadhdhoo to Laamu.  The restaurants offer a large variety of dishes, in our package both lunch and dinner were included. The service was great. The variety of activities offered by the resort is also amazing, many of them complimentary. We did surf, paddle surf, kayack, snorkel, meditation and yoga, and enjoyed very much all of them. A good gym for cardio and strength workout. Top class massage service by Som, a great‚Ä¶"
"Wow! Wow! Wow! Six sensesLaamu was such an incredible experience. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted by so many friendly faces. We got a quick tour of the hotel facility and then taking straight to our beach Villa. Our ‚ÄúGEM,‚Äù Alex, Took care of everything. She checked the sin, she made reservations, she figured out all the travel details, she planned a special birthday, she told us not to worry About anything because she would have it handled. I was shocked to Alex‚Äôs great service. No waiting to check in, no worrying about scheduling Covid test or transportation home. I had nothing else to do but relax! What a true vacation and this was just the beginning. CJ, the head bartender, greeted us and quickly became a great friend like family. He always came by to greet us‚Ä¶"
"Our stay over all was great, it was a much needed vacation. The staff was great specially our GEM Aslah he helped us plan our day and take the opportunity  to enjoy all activities during our stay.  The only disadvantage is the Resturant available the menus are very limited."

"I would like to thank the resort for the wonderful days have spent with my wife for the honeymoon specially Mr. Mina for his kidness, assistance, professional, his moral and good listening. He let me and my wife return back to my country with big smile in our face. Really i will come to the resort becuse his professional way with us."
"Shifu our Anniversary (Guest Experience Manager) made our Anniversary perfect!  More than perfect service‚Ä¶she is now family!  The snorkel/dive team took away all fears, the sailing coach was amazing, the spa first class, the food UNBELIEVABLE, our server (& all servers) Shuaau was amazing, our Barman Mario was so cool,‚Ä¶.

"Laid-back paradise  My husband and I spent a wonderful week at Six Senses Laamu resort. It really was an unforgettable experience! Literally every little detail has been thought of and finessed here, this is not just your standard 5 star resort. I will try and condense our experiences, though please understand there were many more positives than I have written below.  Service -  Every staff member is welcoming, from the General Manager, to the Gardeners. I believe that this not only reflects everyone's passion for their job, but also the sense that no matter the job position, there is real respect between staff members and respect for one another.   Service was always delivered in a personal way, never robotically, often with our names being used. Staff were always attentive and‚Ä¶"

"My wife and I travelled with my brother-in-law and his girlfriend to celebrate my birthday and his birthday.  We were blown away from the beginning.  We were introduced to our GEM Alex who is so amazing and such a sweet person.  She gave us a small tour of some of the dining options as well as the ice cream bar.  While we were walking, we met CJ who is the bar manager.  He greeted us right away and when he heard it was my brother in law‚Äôs birthday, he gave us all a complimentary tequila shot.  Great way to feel welcomed.  From there, Alex took us to our over water villa.  The nice thing about this part was that we didn‚Äôt have to wait to check in.  They already had our villa assigned to us.  We arrived to our villa and it was stunning and breathtaking.  My wife and I were in‚Ä¶"
It was my first time visiting Maldives and my first holiday abroad after the pandemic. I was worried about the travelling and Covid related safety.  I chose Six Senses Laamu as it is located in a bit far away place from the main island Male.  From the day I made my booking directly with the resort till my last day yesterday I had such a stress free holiday!! I am so glad that I chose Six Senses Laamu :)  my GEM (Guest Experience Maker) Edith is a great host and she made my everyday experience in the resort sooo enjoyable and relaxing !!  A huge thank you to Edith!!  The views and the Lagoon Water Villa I stayed are just the best and it is truly Paradise on Earth.

"The best place I have ever been. The paradise. All the activities, food, facilities, are incredible. I would like to mention all the staff, from cleaning the room, to the kitchen, throughout  diving team, biologists, waiters and, of course, GEM‚Äôs, particularly Shifu who cares of us all the time, Shaaku, Yoosuf, Mahidch, that are really kind and gives you good attention. Diving, snorkeling, spa, and private island are totally recommendable. Hope to come back again. Meanwhile, good luck and all the best."
"This is the paradise, not only because it‚Äôs Maldives, but also because this is the best Resort we have ever been. So delicious food (Leaf Restaurant is amazing) lovely room (We were on the water villa, super recommendable) , amazing activities (Diving and Private Island is a must) and EXCELLENT staff. Specially mention to Shaaku, Yoosuf, Mahidch and our GEM, Shifu, who, all of them, cares of us, giving their best to live the best experience during these eight days here.   Thank you, Six Senses Laamu. We could live a dream in our Honeymoon. This is life, literally."
"I stayed at Six Senses Laamu for a week as part of my honeymoon trip and our stay was nothing short of perfection. The resort transports you to a parallel world of tranquillity, happiness and relax unlike anything I have ever experienced before. Starting from the airport pick-up and speed boat trip we knew our stay was going to be something else as they explained how in the island, they prefer guests to lose their shoes and walk around bare footed to be more in contact with nature.  Our arrival was greeted by the different section managers of the hotel, which gave as a sense of proximity and commitment from all the staff of the hotel. From there we were ushered by our Guest Experience Maker (GEM) named Hamza. From that moment onward Hamza was my second favourite person on the‚Ä¶"
We absolutely loved every minute of our trip.   Special mention to Aslah our gem and Nasru the food and beverage manager.

Hamish and Holly.  Luke and Robin.  Saif.  Uma. Were all absolutely incredible.  They made our holiday absolutely memorable.  Luke and Hamish took my son and I to all the best breaks and Luke looked after me when things got hairy üôè so grateful to you all for everything.   Keep doing what your doing everyone. X
"An amazing experience.   The beauty of the island and natural surroundings are a given, what truly bolsters the experience is the ever friendly and incredibly polite people who work tirelessly to ensure you are as happy and comfortable as possible.   I cannot thank the team at Six Senses enough, however I would be remiss if I did not mention Shuaau and Ansa, who both made the experience very friendly and warm with their constant attention to detail and conversation. I must also mention Rana, the shy but unbelievable pancake maestro who always ensured there was something extra special available every morning for breakfast and who provided one of the highlights of the trip: the ice-cream bar! Ofcourse there was also our GEM Ravvah, who acted tirelessly to ensure every little‚Ä¶"
"Quite simply the best holiday we have ever had!   Laamu is a fantastic location; however it was the friendly staff and their impeccable service that made our stay so special.  From our guest experience maker Shah, who went above and beyond his duties to arrange our experiences and ensure he was always there for us‚Ä¶ to Sharu and Aksham who always greeted us with a smile at breakfast, Sagar who made the best cocktails at sip sip and Ibrahim our friendly cleaner.  We simply cannot name everyone on here, but the staff are a true credit to the hotel and its ethos‚Ä¶ delivering fantastic service and doing so in a  truly conscious and sustainable way!"
"Six senses was beautiful, heaven on Earth, but what made the stay even more spectacular was the special service we received from the staff, in particular Mina. He was truly a blessing. He served us from morning till night anything we needed and even checked on us after our trip ended! His service became a friendship.   Definitely recommend this resort! Great scenery, amenities, food, staff!"
"The staff there were amazing! Always happy and made post wedding an incredible experience for us. One person in particular, mina, made the visit very clear for us and was super hospitable.

One of the best hotels in the world with the best staff service and always smiling with a pleasure to help all the client and always taking care of all the residents . The view of the villa is so beautiful in the sunrise and sunset i really like it and helps you in meditation .  i would really recommend it for anyone who would like to chill and relax because this would be the right spot to do so.
"It was an amazing experience, we had such a good time. The hotel is perfect, food, drinks, people, open ice cream ‚Ä¶. Great and beautiful Pancakes made by Rana ! Loved the breakfast. Lobster dinner at the beach was so amazing, uncredable sunset, with perfect dinner. The dives are breath taken, different corals and so cool waves. Nick, Dottie, Sasha, Fiona, Isis, the best !!!

"Me and my sister had the most incredible time while staying at the Six Senses. Once we have arrived at the airport they treated us like princess:) some one was waiting for us to get our luggages and  he took us to private lounge.Then,he prepared for us the boarding pass to take another domestic flight . Then we arrived to the resort  the entire staff greeted  us. Our GEM, SHAH  was the best . He was always available for us and he took such care of us . All the stuff are AMAZING!!! We stayed at over water villa it was the best. I love the nature ,and the atmosphere. This resort is a MUST to visit."
"Paradise nor utopia simply can‚Äôt justify the unforgettable experience my family and I just spent at the Six Senses Laamu in the Maldives.  The combination of serene clear blue water, white sandy beaches, vibrant coral fish, immaculate grounds, purposefully built overwater villas and breathtaking sunsets mixed with amazing cuisine and friendly staff easily made this the best vacation of my life.   What to expect: 1st class diving - 1 hour dives off pristine dive boats at 18 meters with 100ft+ visibility.  Close encounters with reef sharks, tuna, thousands of colorful game and reef fish, eels, mantas (if you‚Äôre lucky) and massive sea turtles. High grade regulators / BC‚Äôs / fins and wetsuits. Amazing dive guides occasionally accompanied by underwater scientists from the Manta Trust‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses Laamu does everything extraordinarily well. The location is breathtaking, the overwater accommodations are specular, and the food beats even the most amazing restaurants in the USA. The staff members are what truly make this place special. They attend to every need and always seem to be two steps ahead with any anticipated desire or whim. They greet you by name, they know where you are from, they remember your preferences for extra ice and lemon with your water at every meal (and whether you want still or sparkling). After nine days in this tropical paradise, I truly feel like family. A special shoutout to the amazing dive staff who made every dive carefree and easy ‚Äì especially Nick Z. who led my wife and I through some of the most epic dives in the last 23 years and‚Ä¶"
"My husband and I booked 9 days at Six Senses Laamu to celebrate our 22nd wedding anniversary. Because we were flying from Colorado in the United States and had never visited the Maldives, we were seeking an exceptional experience. We've traveled to many tropical destinations, but this one blew us away. Of course, the Maldives are incredibly picturesque, but the Six Senses resort manages to build on that natural beauty with a sustainable design philosophy mixed with elegance everywhere you look. We were upgraded from a water villa to a sunset water villa on Jetty A, and the room was spacious, spotless, and filled with every possible amenity one could wish for. Privacy? Check. Outdoor shower and glass bathtub? Check. Towel-draped double day-bed looking out over the water? Check.‚Ä¶"
The experience has been exceptional!! Stunning place. One of the best places we have ever been. Nature is fantastic and everybody welcomed us. Outstanding service with a special mention to our GEM Hamzath. Very helpful and always planning great activities!!!
"My wife and I stayed here for the first week of our honeymoon. Service, food and accommodations were incredible from start to finish. Thank you to our GEM, Aslah and the staff for making our trip so memorable. Highly recommend staying here if you‚Äôre visiting the Maldives!!!"
"Me and my husband had the most incredible time on our honeymoon at the Six Senses. We arrived and the entire staff greeted us and did an extremely thorough introduction and tour of the grounds. Our GEM, Aslah, was the BEST! He was always available and took such good care of of us from the moment we arrived right up until we departed. This was our first time at the six senses and it won‚Äôt be our last!"
"We had the best week at Six Senses Laamu. We traveled with our children, ages 6 and 8, and couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better experience. We split our time between an Ocean Beach Villa and an Overwater Villa. You can‚Äôt go wrong with either. The beach villas provided a little more space for a family of 4, but the overwater villas have the bonus of being able to jump in and swim in the amazing water. The team at The Den (the name of the kids club) were so great with our two kids. We had to drag them out to spend time with us and they did such fun and unique activities. Our kids will miss them so much. Another thanks to our GEM, Aslah, and the staff at Sip Sip, where we spent most of our days. Also, take lessons from the Tropic Surf team if you can- the best instructors!"
The place is amazing .. you will feel you self and the nature good clean rooms delicious food varieties. Mena is the best manger their he took a good care of us ..  I will come back for sure once I want to disconnect.
"WOW, this has been the trip of a lifetime and mostly because of the extremely dedicated, helpful and attentive staff! The service is what makes this place stand out from any other tropical luxury resort. Our water bungalow over the crystal blue water, beautiful sea creatures, scuba diving, snorkeling, and surfing we‚Äôre some of our favorite things!    Aslah, our dedicated GEM (guest experience maker), was spectacular! He could practically guess what we wanted before we even asked! We love you!!   Dottie from the scuba dive center was so sweet and helpful during our two scuba dive trips! They even take photos of you underwater and send them to you the same day!  The pancake artist at the morning buffet exceeded our expectations every day with a different beautiful creation!   I‚Ä¶"

"This place is like you are living in dreamland. I keep pitching myself to make sure I‚Äôm not dreaming. It is one of the best hotels I have stayed after traveling to other places. Everyone at six senses were welcoming and full of smile. Felt like I was at home. Before coming to six senses, we agreed that it would be once in life to visit Maldives. After this, we will be back to celebrate our 5th year anniversary and will stay longer than what we stayed.   Our GEM was amazing and accommodating. Everything about six senses is amazing. We miss the relaxation and the environment already. It is barely one month since we got home from the Maldives.  So glad that we picked this place over many resorts out in Maldives.   See you soon!!   We thought about checking the sisters of six senses‚Ä¶"

"Six senses, an absolute paradise. I would like to ask for two minutes of your time.   Speaking from someone who has seen a lot of different places and hotels all over the world, this is on another level. Six Senses Laamu, is a combination  of everything a guest could ever ask for. The restaurants were fantastic and every evening was a new experience. I could not be more pleased. There were a lot of new food combinations on the menu which I had not tried before and I would like to give you a warm recommendation - Please trust the chef because he knows what he is doing :)   Furthermore, I would like to take the opportunity to thank everyone at Six Senses Laamu for making my stay an unforgettable one.

This resort is a hidden gem. It must beThe best hotel in the hole Maldives.  Me and my family stayed for one week in a sunset villa and it was truly amazing. We loved everything . The restaurants and drinks are topclass. Our gem Aslah is a true Gem. He Will fix every need You have.  We willl definately come back !
"When we decided to go to Maldives on a family vacation, the criteria the travel agent was asked to meet were extensive. We picked the Six Senses Laamu to stay because of its amenities, luxury and service reviews. But what awaited for us when we arrived was so much more!   First, the over water bungalows were perfect! They were sized perfectly, fitted with all the luxuries and amenities including an open air bath and shower! The views were gorgeous! The Six Senses Laamu is located on a reef which allowed us to go snorkeling with ease.   The property has several qualified marine biologists on staff. This meant our kids could enroll in junior marine biology classes and experience not only in classroom learning but also go out with a marine biologist with full snorkeling equipment,‚Ä¶"
"We stayed at the Six Senses Laamau for 7 days and it was a dream from start to finish. We have traveled all over the world to lots of beautiful places, but the Six Senses beats the all.  When we arrived, the General Manager with staff welcomed us which made us feel very welcome. We stayed in the sunset ocean villas and they are fantastic. The villas are built in wood with its own private sundeck outside. They are very cosy but at the same time exclusive, so the combination is great.  The outside shower and bath is unbelievable , still very private. The ocean is the cleanest and most beautiful we ever seen so to try snorkeling or diving is a must!  The restaurants are also top notch, serving fantastic foods with great service! By fantastic I mean like one or two stars in Guide‚Ä¶"
"Six senses Laamu has very welcoming staffs, our GEM ( guest experience manager) Shah, was almost like Magic lamp he granted us whatever we wished and needed for our stay, he was checking on us every couple ours, updated us for the events everyday.  I have been around the world into so many good resorts but Six senses Laamu has very different vibe. We felt very very welcome since all the staffs were very friendly everyone called us by our name, they would remember our preferences and ... which I think it shows how much they cared about their guests.    The nature in Laamu was very beautiful I chose the resort by its pictures but honestly it has beauty that only eyes can capture it.   Best trip we‚Äôve ever have so far‚Ä¶  Looking forward to visit Sixsenses Laamu and our Gem‚Ä¶"
"Probably the best trip I did ever! It was a lengthy trip for me (3 connections) but you get to the island you forgot about everything. I did several aqua sports, mainly scuba diving and snorkeling. The spa is amazing with different massages. different restaurants available and each one is an experience. I recommend Sip Sip for lunch (near the pool and beach) for dinner it is difficult to pick what was the best one - Japanese (zen), Leaf (incredible with wine pair tasting), Chill (with the open ocean in front of you), the Asian night with the state-of-the art buffet. The room (villa) is the BEST! The shower you can see and listen the ocean. I was blessed during my visit to testify a turtle egg hatching!!!! All perfect! But you know what is really the great difference of this‚Ä¶"
Everthing was amazing..from food to surfing things were top notch..one of the vacation we would never forget..all the staffs were always very helpful & caring..special thanks to My GEM Aslah who went above & beyond to make our stay memorable..Also our room attendant Thalfah & the staffs from tropic surf specially holly & hamesh..Thanks all..cant wait to come back..see you soon
"The Best possible stay ever with the Help of Aslah , our Gem assistant , and Talfah our Villa attendant who was completely helpfull like all the staff!  Perfect in all the senses, Will definitly Plan our next trip Back soon also with the kids !"
"Excellent customer service from arrival at the airport to departure.  The facilities are well kept; my son loved the children‚Äôs club (Zaby & Naiha). Special thanks to our GEM who was a gem. He took care of any requests, needs or wants - thank you Aslah. To our Villa attendant (Sihanouk), the marine and dive team (Afaz, Steven and Alt); the chef Rahul who made my chappati everyday despite it not being on the menu and to the entire restaurant team - but especially Hittu; thanks for making my stay in paradise  my 11 year old in tow; totally awesome"
"We had a wonderful week in June at this very well designed and laid out resort. The villas are quite unique, with a number of unusual and fun features. The food is great, and the staff is extremely friendly and well-trained, with a real ‚ÄúCan Do‚Äù attitude. The Tropicsurf team at the resort offers great surfing instruction with easy and fast access to a wide range of terrific breaks within 10 minutes of the resort; the team, led by Hamish and Holly, is second to none. With many restaurants to choose from, our favorite was Leaf, which has the look and feel of a tree house, overlooking the farm/garden where much of the food is grown. Guests are assigned a Guest Experience Manager (GEM), and ours - Aslah - was always cheerful and helpful. Don‚Äôt miss the spa, especially the incredibly‚Ä¶"
"It was a very nice vacation. Our guide Shaha took care of everything to give us a wonderful and unforgettable vacation. The food was fantastic and you have in the various restaurants   many options. The water bungalow has the best view of the sea. All of the staff are nice and accommodating and do their best not to cause you any inconvenience. All in all, the best vacation I could wish for myself and my mom."
"Absolutely everything was amazing. The food, the views no matter at what sight you are at, the incredible environment and an extremely kind staff made of our experience the best we could have. Highly recommended for honeymooners."
"We had a great time at the six senses. Our nearly 4 year old daughter was the queen of the hotel, she was spoiled from everyone, especially with all types of pane cakes (dolphin, Spyder, manta,..). We made friends with a couple of people, enjoyed ourselves in the spa and the privacy of our villa. Snorkling was phenomenal, just in front of the Chill Bar, you get to see all types of fishes, even turtles, sting rays and sharks. Breakfast and Dinner was always delicious, any place of restaurant was amazing. The key thing for us was that there is no ""No"" to any question you ask. The team is outstanding. We will definitely go back there again."
"Six Senses Laamu has became our favorite corner in the world. Just two visits have been enough. Excellent hotel with all kind of details to make us enjoy in family. Many activities and qualified personnel allow good moments for all the family. Supreme service, amazing location, luxury villas, great restaurants and breakfast, big variety of water sports, etc etc All these points and others have made our experience unique.  Thank you Six Senses Laamu staff, especially Shifu, our GEM.  We will come back.  Ana, Jose, Juan and Alberto"
"I am speechless! I simply don‚Äôt have the vocabulary to describe our experience at the Six Senses property in the remote Laamu Atol.  Six Senses, Malidves, Laamu Atol, is the most amazing property and location that we have ever stayed at. We are a married couple who have been together for 20 years and we have traveled the world. We have been incredibly fortunate to have traveled multiple times to many countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, the Americas, and the South Pacific and have stayed at truly unique, beautiful, and outstanding luxury boutique unique properties over the last 20 years.

"That I extended my stay by 2 weeks should say it all! The only thing that drew me back home was starting to miss my friends. The good and the bad: Bad: nothing..absolutely nothing!  Good: this will take some time.. This was my first time at Six Senses Laamu, and certainly not my last! I came for diving, which has an endless amount of life and sites, the most dramatic being the channels, where you usually reef-hook yourself to a rock and watch the amazing life go by: sharks, rays, schools and schools of jacks, barracudas and more. Then there are sites (10 minutes from Six Senses dive center) where most often you'll be seeing manta rays circling cleaning stations. Should they not appear on a dive, there are turtles, sting rays, schools of fish (barracudas, etc.) to see. Their dive‚Ä¶"
"Everything about our stay here was excellent. Special thanks to the hosts Shamin, Shafraz, chef Latheef, dive instructor Steve and our Guest Experience Manager Aslah for going above and beyond to make our time here extraordinary."
"It was our first time in the Maldives, and we are so glad we choose Six Senses, because it was the most great experience we could have got.  Since the 1st minute they got us at the AirPort until the last day they drop us there, everything was PERFECT. Our GEM Abdulla was so dedicated, 5‚≠êÔ∏è, he made us feel like home, but with sun, sea, sand, turtles and snorkling! We wish all the best for you and your family!

"The diving is fantastic. The dive boat and crew are the best, and there is a great camera room to handle all of your photo equipment. The accommodations in an overwater bungalow are first rate, with plenty of space, privacy, and stunning views of the water and sky. There are several restaurants that all have delicious offerings of everything you could want (not to mention the free ice cream bar). It is the second time I've been there and I definitely want to go back."
"How would one describe Six Senses Laamu without immediately feeling peace. We spent two weeks at six senses with a 3 and 5 year old and nothing was short of amazing. From the amazing welcome to the surreal water villa (they made two extra beds for the kids which was a lovely touch).  Every morning we would watch the turtles pass by in the morning grazing on sea grass and watch as the multitude of fish swim by. Then we would cycle( you are provided with bicycles to help yo move around the island, and for people like me a tricycle with a basket to put the children on) over to have breakfast where Serana (the islands pastry chef and ice cream maker, they have over 40 flavours which you can try all as you can have as much as you want through out your stay!!) He would treat the kids‚Ä¶"

"A place to call home  I am in love with this place!  Starting from arrival experience and till the departure you feel that you are a part of something bigger, not just a vacation, - a part of the family, of the philosophy and nature.   The barefoot philosophy, bikes with your initials, dolphins passing by during breakfast at over water restaurant, turtles right next to the villa.   Indeed this a place where all your senses get awakened.   The spa is a must while you are here, be it from Yoga, meditation or massage. (They are on the top of their game)  The villas has minimalistic touch to it yet so elegant and every detail has been thought out thoroughly, starting from having a TV in the bathroom (which you can watch whole lying on your bathtub) and ending bathroom amenities.

Our wonderful GEMs Aslah and Shah as well as bartender and somm CJ and Kareem took care of everything we needed and more! The location is incredible and the most beautiful resort we have visited. There are tons of things to do, but the natural beauty of the surroundings makes it easy to relax and feel at home ‚Äúdoing nothing‚Äù. The resort is small and intimate and even if we didn‚Äôt meet everyone, we still felt like we had seen most people staying here.

"The best place I have ever been too. I spent 6 weeks on Laamu and it was 6 of the best weeks of my life. Eveyrything from the service, the rooms, the beauty of the island and the food was simply amazing. I was there mainly for the surf and the waves didn't disapoint either. We had 5 weeks of fantastic surf and 1 week when it was super Windy and we couldnt really surf. But by that time we where pretty surfed out so it didn't really matter. Tropic surf who is the surf company on site have fantastic surf guides/coahes and I had the best time surfing with them.

"My partner and I had an incredible trip to six senses; we are overly grateful for the entire team there for making our stay wonderful and simple.  Tho (our GEM) was ...a gem!    We mainly went to surf and relax after this insane year with Covid.  The tropic Surf team stationed @ Laamu was awesome.  Big thanks to Hamish, Holly, and Umar for getting us out to the local breaks and being so kind.  Staying in the beach villa was a nice departure from the typical water villas across Maldives.  These were very private and quiet.  Also - let it be known - the F+B team really worked hard to accomodate us and other guests with any special requests.  Both my girlfriend and I are vegan and we never missed out on anything.  Much thanks."

"We have been 7 days at Six Senses Lammu, it was an incredible experience that we never could imagine. it is the best resort to come in  those moments because it is a safe place, you don‚Äôt have to wear mask (just in closed rooms) , they control your temperature every day and all the team is vaccinated. So I feel very safe at six senses.  The resort is sustainable resort who look after the reef very well and they have 10 marine biologist to take of all the sea life. Snorkeling is amazing here. You have a stunning views from your room, food is delicious and they have deference dining options throughout the day ( my favorite was the Mediterranean soak)  , fantastic service, unforgettable experiences doing water sports, the Spa is lovey and incredible ambiance.

"My husband and I loved our honeymoon in the beautiful Maldives. The hospitality and warmth we were met with upon our arrival was a constant all week. We loved the staff, the pristine waters, the naturalistic and luxurious environment was only made better by the complimentary homemade ice cream shop, which we frequented daily. Staff members went out of their way to make our experience extraordinary - truly going above and beyond our dreams. We can‚Äôt wait to visit again or perhaps venture to another Six senses somewhere else because we know we will be in great care wherever we land! We love you, thank you!!! ü§ç"
"I spent 12 joyful nights at the Six Senses Laamu resort with a few friends. The resort staff performed diligently - beginning at the booking process and throughout the entire stay.  Before confirming the booking, the resort staff answered all questions we had promptly by email. Once we arrive in Male, a resort representative greeted us at the international terminal and helped us transfer to the domestic terminal's business lounge. The rep also managed the check-in process while we were in the lounge and walked us to the gate when the domestic flight was ready for boarding. When we arrived at the Kadhdhoo Airport, we were again greeted by two resort Guest Experience Managers (GEMs) and transfer by speed boat to the resort.

Big shout outs to Ziyaan, Bala, Akshem and Hisham for taking such good care of us throughout the day! Trevor and Shah always made sure to check in with us!

"Where to start... A beautiful stay at Six Senses Laamu. The rooms, food, beaches, staff, waves. The stunning bare foot luxury vibe of Six Senses let's you slip into relaxation mode from the minute you set foot on the island. Snorkeling directly from the room was incredible, but I have to mention  the food as this blew me away. The quality of ingredients, selection and menu preparation was incredible.  Thanks to Haseef, Aslah and Faarish for making sure everything was perfect throughout the stay. Also Hamish and Holly the on site Surf Team were incredible!   Thanks again everyone, I will be back for sure!"
"Amazing stay. Service was perfect, very thoughful people, with attention to every detail. Impressive facilities, with activities to do all day if you would like - not just a ""stay at the beach"" hotel, even if the beach is breath taking"
"Absolutely epic! Amazing food (every single time on either restaurant), stunning villas and natural surroundings, we surfed good waves every day! There are always things to do even for non surfers and simply cruising and snorkeling around the island is just incredible, lot‚Äôs of wildlife at your doorstet. Aslah, our butler, took care of every single detail. 100% coming back!"
"I don‚Äôt even know where to begin. The attention to detail - from the food to the amenities in the villas is put of this world. Everything throughout the resort is so well taken care of. Not to mention the whole sustainability aspect is awesome. You can tell that Six Senses puts a lot of efforts, thoughts and time into making luxury travel more sustainable.  Big thanks to Faarish and Aslah for taking good care of us. You guys are legends"

"The best times I ever had in my life! Beside the breathtaking view, the food and all the activities, six senses staff is the best ever! I would like to thank all the closest staff. Shifu is the best GEM, very kind, respectful and a good friend. Trevor, shaku (the waiter) and the fruit guy. Everyone is so kind and took care of us with so much love! We cant wait to come back as soon as possible! Thans Six Senses Laamu for the best honeymoon ever!"
"Six Senses Laamu is stunningly beautiful. The staff is super helpful, The food is second to none. Their sustainability approach is impressive. They reduce single use plastic and carbon foot print by a degree that I wouldn't have expected to be possible."
This was my first time at the Maldives. Six senses Laamu fulfilled my expectations of a dream vacation at the Maldives to 100%. The food is great and diverse and the staff is very caring about you all the time. Especially your personal Gem is looking after you for the entire stay at this beautiful and sustainable resort.  Six Senses Laamu offers the best homemade ice cream I have ever had in my life. The spa area is an actual dream. The diving Center is very professional and experienced. I tried diving for the first time and got addicted very soon. The hotel has a great house reef where you can spot everything from a turtle to rays and sharks.   Also the rooms are very well thought out. Even though there are many rooms/villas you enjoy and incredible privacy and peaceful stay.‚Ä¶
"The hotel is located in the south of the Maldives, hence one needs to take a commercial flight before a boat ride, once you get there it will be all worth it. You are hosted by the staff and presented to your GEM (Guest Experience Manager) who will take care of you for the stay. In my case, I was lucky to have Shifu making sure my stay was spotless. This is an important part of the whole experience.   The island is small, but you will need bikes to move around, which makes the whole experience corky and fun. The rooms are fantastic, I stayed in an overwater villa with a private pool. The decor is rustic and charming, but with all the comfort one needs. Some of the highlights are the breakfast in the room, which is truly special. Sunsets are also incredible from either the sea or‚Ä¶"
"This place is the closest to heaven we have ever been. Best accommodation, barefoot policy, amazing food and best coral reef in the country. Snorkeling just under your villa, swimming with turtles... A dream!"
"Everything was perfect! The room was really nice, our GEM was extremely nice, the food was really good, the whole staff was very friendly, the massages were great and the view of the spa perfect. I also have to mention the delicious ice cream :) The place is beautiful, they really think of every little detail! Thank you for wonderful unforgettable days!"
"I am still impressed with this great place!  Amazing villas, people and activities.  Perfect atoll for diving and meeting ocean creatures. Home reef beautiful too, a lot of turtles that were really friendly. Another amazing event was turtle hatchling. Hotel biologists help them to have natural and safe trip to the ocean.  I had different positive emotions in this place.  Special thanks to my GEM Aslah, who supported me all holidays. Ihusaan who keeped my villa in perfect contrition. My lovely fruit ninja in the restaurant Rahul. And most attentive waiter Shaah. Haisham from the dive team for amazing time. And all surf team :) Lovely place, hope to return."

Greetings to my GEM Aslah who always helped to be into all activities and feel absolutely comfortable and non-stressed! And for Ihusaan who always keeped my villa tidy and fresh :)  I will recommend this hotel to my friends and family. That‚Äôs the paradise!"
"This was our second time to the Maldives, and the second time to Six Senses Laamu Beach Resort. Our expectations were far exceeded on our first visit, so we knew what to expect the second time around. However, Six Senses Laamu continues to impress with unmatched hospitality, service and overall experiences. On a scale of 1-5 with 5 being the highest, Six Senses Laamu is a 10! It's luxury without ostentation.  We appreciate their emphasis on wellness and sustainability, core values of the brand that are seen and experienced throughout the entire resort. As self-described foodies (we like to eat!), the focus on local, seasonal and sustainable ingredients that comprise all the dishes on offer at all of the restaurants was not only well-noted and appreciated, but also inspiring to‚Ä¶"
"We have just ended our honeymoon in Six Senses Laamu. We couldn‚Äôt be more in peace, connected with nature, happier and fulfilled.  All the different experiences available, such as snorkeling trips, a day in a desert island (absolutely breath taking), all the lunch and dinners and interesting workshops, the SPA... this hotel is unique and we are totally in love with it, not only for the many activities and quality, but also (and maybe mostly) because of all the people who work here and make this healthy and happy environment possible. We are amazed with all the joy, attention, professionalism and all the love, caring and dedication in everything they do. It was truly inspiring for us and we hope to come back one day. We couldn‚Äôt ask for a better honeymoon!"
"Six Senses Laamu is truly one of a kind. The breathtaking approach to the resort on the short boat ride sets the stage for a once in a lifetime vacation. The staff at Six Senses are all delightful and helpful, making you feel at home from the minute you step off the boat and on to the resort. Our GEM, Ali, helped book all excursions and restaurant reservations, as well as stop us while biking to redirect us to the baby sea turtle hatching! He really made our honeymoon the best it could possibly be.  The food and drinks at Six Senses did not disappoint either!

We spent a LOT of time looking at all the other resorts in the Maldives but were won over by the uniqueness of location and the weather conditions at Laamu.

"Maldives‚Äô best! Six Senses Laamu is barefoot luxury island resort in the Indian Ocean. Barefoot in a sense where they inspire you to experience the island for what it truly is. Natural, blissful, organic, beautiful.   In a world full of all things gold-plated, Six Senses Laamu strips the veneer off of the blingy luxury, allowing one to see, taste, and feel the purity of the experience. A universe in itself. I felt like I walked into the pages of a Robinson Crusoe novel. Beyond a resort, this is a place of healing. Laamu showed me how to reconnect with nature, with food, with wellness, most of all, with myself. Here, I realized how the masks we choose to put on daily weight us down. Six Senses is about taking our masks off, allowing one‚Äôs true self to shine through the layers and‚Ä¶"
"It was a wonderful trip. My wife and me had a remarkable experience there. This white sand and blue water will stay in my memories for decades. Staffs there are also professional, my GEM Emma especially excellent. My wife had serious seasick but at there we could go snorkeling right off the island without sailing out. We even saw sharks and baby turtle hatching. In a word, it would be a never regret choice if one goes to Maldives ."
The hotel excelled is almost everything despite the crisis in the world. Staff are always friendly  and helpful. Hotel is spotless clean and facilities are very well maintained. Proper Chefs offer great choices of international food in the restaurants. Edith was a great host and MUI team from Water Sports were awesome during our stay. It was a memorable holiday away from reality.
"Six Senses Laamu was quite simply amazing, from the time we stepped onto the island until the time we left.  I'm not sure I can say enough about it, but Ill go through all of the positives (I'm not sure there was a negative).  1. Staff -The staff was wonderful.  Our GEM, Shifu, took care of everything we needed our entire trip with a smile on her face.  Always just a phone a call away, she was able to answer all of our questions, make arrangements and suggestions for us, and made us feel welcome and informed throughout our stay.

"My wife and I just returned from a week long stay at the Six Senses Laamu and had a wonderful time. The resort is beautifully integrated into the island and provides secluded but easily accessible areas throughout. We took advantage of incredible reef snorkelling that was provided complimentary each day by marine biologist members of the Maldivian Underwater Initiative (MUI). We saw green turtles, rays and reef sharks, and were able to ask all of our questions to the incredibly well educated and experienced staff (our snorkel tours were led by Ali and Joe, who both provided an entertaining and educational experience).

Was our first time in the Maldives and we wanted somewhere relaxing, peaceful, luxury w/great food. SS was recommended a lot (we‚Äôre European if helpful for context): its now clear why.  SS takes every possible attention to detail, from sustainability/products made+recycled on the island (plastic is rare, unusual for the maldives), daily menus based on fresh produce available, a freeflow icecream bar, exceptional wellness facilities (best spa menu I‚Äôve ever seen).

"When you book with a brand such as Six Senses, your expectations are already high. Somehow the Laamu team manage to exceed them at every turn. This is a place that will leave your body and mind feeling good, and rejuvenated.   From their attention to detail to their embodiment of wellness, and sustainable luxury. This is where you go to live a real barefoot wellness experience in a circular ecosystem.   I can go on about the beauty of the resort but my words won't paint a better picture than the photos posted. Better yet, go there and see it for yourself, some things can't be captured. The Villas are out of this world, outdoor showers, straight on the water, roof decks, all the makings of a romantic hideaway.   The real charm of the place is made by the people that are there,‚Ä¶"
Thank you Aslah and the rest of the six senses crew. We had the best honeymoon week that we could ever wish for. Incredible service and amazing food. The rooms were perfectly cleaned and the enviroment on top!

"Six Senses Laamu is a must go to destination. If you're looking for a Maldives destination, I wouldn't look any further. My husband and I came here for our honeymoon and it was PERFECT! We stayed in the over water villas, and loved every inch of space here. From the outdoor shower, to the glass bottom bathtub, to the sun roof, and deck into the ocean, you will likely not find another amenity quite like this. We loved being able to jump off of our deck and go snorkeling right beneath us. Food was excellent, and we enjoyed all activities. We even got to see a sea turtle hatching during our stay! Quite remarkable! The staff at the resort really make this place what it is. They are the most welcoming, genuine and hospitable staff and they all spoke really great english. Our GEM‚Ä¶"
"Excellent stay! The staff went over and beyond for everything.  My daughter loved going to the kids club everyday and  enjoyed all the different activities... especially the mango sorbet making!

Good snorkeling was all around and we saw plenty of sea turtles, sharks, sting rays and colorful fish.  Of the six resorts we have previously stayed in the Maldives this was by far our favorite and we will definitely be back!"
"The experience from start to finish with the team at Six Senses Laamu is immaculate. Upon arrival to Male the team ensures your trip out to their little slice of paradise is stress free.  Upon getting on the boat to travel to the resort, you are able to relax and enjoy the wonderful area that is the Laamu atoll.  The team goes out of their way to ensure your trip is smooth and enjoyable all the way through. Our GEM, Nasru, did a great job ensuring we were able to do experience everything we wanted to without stressing about when or where we needed to be.  Throughout our stay, we were treated as friends by the wonderful staff that makes up the Six Senses team. From the chef who took so much pride in making his pancakes every morning to ensure people's children were happy and fed‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses Laamu is possibly one of the easiest places to enjoy a truly unforgettable Maldives experience. You can be snorkelling on the house reef to surfing some of the best breaks in the Maldives with Tropicsurf in a matter of minutes! The staff make you feel at home and the energy felt by the hospitality gives you that sense of fulfilment and relaxation which is what is needed on a holiday in paradise! I was blown away by the knowledge and professionalism of the MUI and Six Senses Sustainability team who definitely opened my eyes to the way the local environment works and how sustainable Six Senses truly are in the way they work! Marteyne the GM is a hoot! Always a smile on her face and goes above and beyond on any request,definitely enjoyed sharing a few glasses of‚Ä¶"
"Thank you to Ashlam(our gem) Shifam (villa attendant), Zaff (reservation), Sagar (Bar waiter). They all made our experience unforgettable. This was a magical holidays for us and thanks to them all was perfect"
"This was our second vacation to Six Senses and we felt so welcomed to be back. The General Manager and  staff make this place great because they are so helpful and friendly. They meet you at the airport and handle all the baggage with transfers; arrival and departure, so you can just relax. We had the same great GEM, Shifu, who arranged all our activities including dining, diving, spa, and cooking class. We again stayed in a great over water villa and enjoyed watching the sunrise every morning on our deck while having morning tea and coffee. The food is out of this world and the menus are varied for those who want to indulge or eat more healthily. The main focus of our trip was for diving and we were blown away by the great dive team at the resort. The guides, captain, and crew‚Ä¶"
"This was the best choice we did ever as family,we booked the overwater villa,mine was n79,it was so beautiful,they provide you with bicycle to move around the island,I got the tricycle cause I didn't know how to drive a bicycle...the restaurants were amazing,I loved the food at sip sip bar ,specially the tuna tartar and the lobster quesadilla and the gazpacho...I recommend these 3 dishes....for breakfast you have a wide choice of eggs,whiteeggsonelette ,which made my day...I loved the pancakes,everyday I chose a form,you can have turtle pancake octopus pancake,dolphin pancake... All the restaurants are wirth trying,specially leaf restaurant. And the real experience was the spa since it rained most of the time ,we decided to have massage every day and face treatments...‚Ä¶"
"The best thing about Six Senses wasn‚Äôt just that the place itself was amazing, it was all about the staff. The staff was experimental and made the stay wonderful. They were always friendly, and ready to help with  anything. The activities were great, so was the food, I just wish the jetski was available."
"We went for 5 nights and our only regret was in not staying longer. The resort accommodations and services are amazing, with all the comfort we were waiting for. The island is a paradise and it surprised us the kindness of every hostess. Everyone was always with a smile in the face ready to help and to anticipate our needs. Our GAM (the local name for a personal assistant) made our trip even better (thanks, Ali). We strongly recommend everyone to visit the spa. The whole experience is like being in heaven (i‚Äôve never been there to tell, but it seems)."
"Best vacations ever!  Highly efficient stuff, that make the week a ultimate  luxury and unforgettable experience.  A parcial thank you to our Gem Aslah and the room cleaning atendant Thalfah, undoubtedly the best!"
"Six Senses Laamu  My fianc√©e and I have traveled quite a bit and have seen many luxury hotels around the world, but Six Senses Laamu is definitely above and beyond.  Every employee is committed to make your stay exceptional and personalized in every possible way. From gourmet homemade healthy and comfort food, countless smiles, proactive personalized service, stylish design and architecture in addition to multiple small details that make your stay unbelievable.  We have enjoyed every minute to the fullest from sunrise to sunset - which are breathtaking at Six Senses Laamu. Our last 7 days have been a firework of wonderful surprises. For sure we can not wait to come back."
Words can't express how fantastic the Six Senses Laamu is. Everything was simply perfect. What really stands out is the exceptional service level and friendliness of all of our wonderful hosts and the entire Six Senses team. We hope to be back soon.
"Wonderful hotel.  Room, restaurants and leisure.  Impeccable service.  Our GEM, Aslah was always there..there was No No for anything..our cleaner Shifam did everything to please. Thanks to all the staffs who made my birthday so memorable..thanks again üòä"
My days at the hotel were wonderful. Restaurant foods were amazing..lots of choices..Service & the staffs were very friendly..our GEM Aslah is a real GEM..Room cleanliness was perfect..our villa attended Shifam was very kind..We will come back again..see you all
"Six senses isn‚Äôt just a beautiful resort, it‚Äôs a VIBE. First off on the boat ride to this private little eco sustainable island they let you remove your shoes (if you want) for a little more connection to the earth and sense of grounding and everyone on the island is barefoot at all times. We loved this! This place was the most perfect honeymoon and now we want to try to visit all of the six senses in the world! Our water villa was stunning and we hopped in the ocean right from our deck every morning for a swim and a snorkel, and everyone gets a bike w their initials as their main mode of transportation during the visit. We went diving and surfing throughout the week, had amazing fresh food, went on an island picnic and a dolphin cruise but we still had plenty of time to relax‚Ä¶"
"My husband and I recently got back from a 5 night stay. I'm still thinking about this holiday and that's proof that it really was perfect. The Six Senses, Laamu surpassed all my expectations and it was hard to fault it. Marlene, the general manager, has that place running like a week oiled machine. The staff are excellently trained, friendly and knowledgeable. The attention is in the details and this is what sets it apart from many resorts. The only negative was a long wait in Male for our connecting domestic flight but once you arrive on the island this is soon forgotten. This is no fault of the Six Senses but with COVID apparently less flight are scheduled daily. We were extremely lucky to get upgraded to a family beach pool villa on arrival and the room and its garden / pool‚Ä¶"
"Ocean Water villa was fantastic, spacious and clean (taken care by Shamin), island is really beautiful, it is not overbuilt with villas, resort is of very high class, food was unbelievable, our GEM Aslah made sure we enjoyed every minute of our stay and arranged for a perfect program for us. We researched a number of high end resorts before deciding on Six Senses, I am glad we made the right choice!  The only problem one will have is realizing it has to end!"
"Dear Mrs.  Marteyne van Well, Let me thank you for the hospitality, warm welcome and service of our group - representatives of the leading travel companies from Kazakhstan.  Special thanks for the professionalism of the resort staff - Mr. Nasru, Mr.  Adam, Mr. Stephen and all team of resort. Six Senses Laamu is an amazing paradise resort for the perfect holiday.  White fine sand beach, bright sunsets and a great house reef.  The resort is perfect for families with children, couples and companies. Excellent cuisine, cozy rooms.The service was amazing. The hotel area is not very large, but very very green.  A bike with an original suspension with your initials is provided for each villa, on which you can easily and quickly move around the island.  Each villa is private and very‚Ä¶"
"The best ever! Six Senses Laamu can mix beautiful landscape,warm sea,full of underwater life in a cozy and self-sustaining hotel. I must say that our GEM Thohir made everything more perfect and left no effort to help us all the time.  The perfect vacation. "
That was amazing trip. I had a great experience of living in one of the most friendly hotels in the world. The great Guest Experience Manager was trying to guess what ever  could wish. All the the people around new my name and wished to help at everything. Still there were a complete privacy. Great opportunities for surfing and snorkeling. Awsome!!!! I wish I would bring my family here)
"My husband and I visited Six Senses Laamu in April 2021! It was the perfect and most romantic place for our honeymooon! Here you can take advantage of many activities including the private SandBank experience, which offers breathtaking views you will never forget.   We were kindly taken care of our GEM , Aslah ,who always made sure we were happy and well taken care of! We never felt like we were missing something because of his prompt and professional work ethic! He was positive, kind, responsive and very very professional! Also, Suhan always kept our villa clean to The best possible standard! He was very conscious of our needs!   Our villa, the Laamu Water Villa offered amazing views of the ocean with an impressive outside shower and a romantic upper deck, a spacious terrace‚Ä¶"
"Me and my wife picked Six Senses Laamu for our honeymoon, and I must say that it was a great decision! From the moment of our arrival, we had the sense that we were in paradise! The hotel staff greeted us, took us on a short tour of the hotel s facilities, after which we were taken to our Laamu Water Villa. Pictures couldn‚Äôt do justice to the beautiful surroundings and awesome over water villa! The most romantic getaway that I can think of! Our GEM was Aslah, who made our stay worry free and took care of all our reservation for all types of activities, dinners, etc. We are very impressed from his professional and prompt service! Also, Suhan, who kept  our villa clean, did it in the most efficient and professional manner; we never had any issue!!! Thank you to all the hotel staff‚Ä¶"
"This place is an absolute heaven for honeymooners. My husband and I went there for our honeymoon in March. We had the best time of our lives, paradise-like living for a week- albeit short, all days were amazing and everything was faultless. Our gem Nasru arranged all bookings for us in a snap. We‚Äôre actually not a fan of review platforms and writing reviews but this place deserve one, our first review ever! Our water villa is stunning, apart from the blue waters, we have a pocket sundeck to enjoy golden hours of sunrise and sunset, crystal stars as the night deepens. We‚Äôre too mesmerized on this! Felt so close to nature night and day! Staff are so friendly and professional, huge thanks to CJ and his team for fizzy cocktails and courteous staff, this spot is amazing!  Six Senses‚Ä¶"
"We stayed at Six Senses Laamu for 5 nights and it absolutely was not enough.  I thought our visit to the Maldives would be a one-time thing, but we were so captivated by Six Senses resort that we will definitely be returning.  The service was fantastic - everyone is very attentive.  You get assigned a General Entertainment Manager (GEM) for your stay - he is your contact for booking activities and restaurants, or for getting anything else you might need.  Our GEM, Abdulla was terrific.  We got in very late the first night, and he had snacks and food waiting for us in the villa.   It's super casual - you basically can go barefoot the whole time, so leave your scrappy sandals at home.  Everyone gets a beach cruiser bicycle to get around the island which is really cute.   We booked‚Ä¶"
"Very close to paradise  Eco sustainable. Minimalist elegance. All details. Best service. Incredible location and views  Food is amazing and super healthy  Top spots for divers: tons of turtles, sharks and if you get lucky huge mantas  Unforgettable"
"Awesome experience. Amazing dives with green turtles, sharks. Beautiful villas in a wonderful sea. Great service. Very good food. Ali, our Guest Experience Manager, helped to make our stay even more fantastic."
"We stayed at Six Senses Lamuu for 10 nights. The little island is private, quiet and beautiful.   There are lots of good spots for snorkeling. We saw turtles, rays and coral reefs in good company with the guides from the hotel (they were all excellent!).   Something worth knowing about Six Senses is that they‚Äôre putting in effort trying to fight climate change and the damage it does to the coral reefs (the bleaching is quite bad already though). For example, instead of having unnatural white beaches, they let the sea grass grow so turtles and other sea animals can thrive, giving tourists the possibility to actually see turtles (we saw lots!).  Food at the hotel was good, especially breakfast. We weren‚Äôt too keen on the concept of buffet for dinner so we simply ordered from the‚Ä¶"
"The people, the resort and the surroundings are all authentically beautiful!  Six Senses Laamu is a must visit destination which offers something for everyone - surfing and diving being on top of the list of to do‚Äôs.   We will definitely be back."
"From the moment we landed in Male, everything was organized and efficient! Every aspect of the resort and our stay seemed like it was planned for maximum comfort and convenience. The staff were absolutely amazing and took care of everything - our designated guest experience manager (Aslah) was super helpful and accommodating. Also Ziaan, one of the restaurant servers, was extremely knowledgable about the cuisine and local vegetation, and our villa attendant (Samah) was exceptional.   The island itself is beyond beautiful and we were really impressed with the sustainability efforts of the resort and the staff. We look forward to coming back again and again!"
Me & my friends visited to six sense Laamu to celebrate our friends 26th wedding anniversary & we got the most amazing hospitality during our stay..things in the island was magical..service was top notch..food was amazing..Our GEM Aslah was outstanding..just a message away..always looking to do something more for us..Thank you six senses laamu..we will be back again.
"A truly unique place and experience that makes a lifetime experience closest to paradise.  Excellent team of professionals and a great human capital that this unique place has.   A must to visit at this time and all times. Will repeat soon.  Keep it as it is, unspoilt, eco friendly and unique."
"Total luxury combined with excellent service, from the moment you land at the local airport to the staff waving goodbye as the boat pulls away at the end of the trip.   It is hard to find fault with the team here, even if looking for something constructive to say. I would say that Dez could update his music catalogue (shout out to Mr Mitchell).  The hours flew by as they became days and days became a week.  Top level service from the GEM's (individual experience managers always on hand via WhatsApp) and able to survive even the most troubling issue. Thanks Ali!  The food and drinks across all the locations, including room, beach and the various restaurants was sublime. Decent wine selection and the buffet above most a la carte menus.   Big thanks again to all the staff there.‚Ä¶"
Everything about the place is simply awesome.Our kids loved the whole experience...Mr.Nasru our GEM made sure that our stay of 5 nights at the resort was perfect.Would love to comeback again for our next holiday!!!
"Come to the island and feel the spirit, the kindness and reconnect to the nature in every way.   So I would like to say:  Thanks to Aslah our Gem, who took care of us and made us feel more then welcome and comfortable thanks to Alvina - the chocolatier - the best chocolate I have ever eaten  thanks to Hemant - who taught and challenged us patiently in Yoga thanks to Shiam ‚Äì for a perfect massage and for the Yoga sessions thanks to Razaan ‚Äì our waiter, who took care of our breakfast and dining wishes   it was overall a perfect holiday  and you made it happen - big thank you"
Six senses was awesome had the most incredible stay would highly recommend! everyone went over and above to make us comfortable !! The food was delicious and the resort itself was beautiful Thank you :)
"I spent 10 days here with my family and the experience was amazing. The island is beautiful, with a loads of lush coral reef near and around the resort. The rooms (ones over the sea) had a phenomenal view and the staff were very helpful and nice. The highlight was definitely the diving as the ocean life is well protected and plentiful. Manta Rays! A special thanks to Aslaa who made our stay just that much more comfortable."
"Top notch, surfing was awesome and some of the best scuba diving I have ever done. Aslaa was superb and very helpful. Beautiful location with loads of activities and great food and easily accessible from male."
"The best and longest holiday we‚Äôve had since the pandemic, staying in this paradise feels like nothing to worry about. Resort has huge efforts to run in proper hygiene and safety protocols which made us feel so relaxed and at peace. We lodged in an overwater villa with the most amazing views we‚Äôve ever seen in our lives, wide blue oceans paired up with pink, orange skies, oh multicolored sometimes, these will leave you in awe! Glass tub, glass floor, sun deck, outdoor shower were amongst the favorites.  Thanks a million for the royalty service from our experience maker. You need to find the Bar for more superb chilling time. Quality and taste of food is at the highest for us. Thanks for free ice cream, spending most afternoons in this popular Ice cream parlor.  To sum it all,‚Ä¶"
"At Six Senses Laamu you will find everything to feel happy, special, spoiled and great! It's definitely the best place I've ever visit! Outstanding resort! I wouldn 't change anything! The best people, the best staff, the best accommodations, incredible food, amazing and delicious breakfast and the best place to reconnect with nature and with your inner self! Don't forget to book the private picnic in a desert island all for you! Surreal!!! Can't wait to be there again and again and again! <3  Miss everything!"
"Incredible Resort, incredible place and incredible people. Very good food quality. 100% recommended. Don‚Äôt forget to book the private picnic experience in a desert island all for you!!! One of the best experiences in my life. "
"We usually go on vacation several times a year. Unfortunately, this was not possible with Covid19 in the last few months. We were at home last year too. After the turbulent year we decided in February to return to our 2nd home for 3 weeks. It was our 9th vacation at Six Senses Laamu. It is our only vacation destination that we have returned to several times and the only place where we felt absolutely safe during the pandemic. Our arrival with Qatar Airways was more relaxed and trouble-free than ever. A PCR test and the digital immigration registration (Imuga) for the Maldives, that's it. Relaxation begins right at the airport, an employee waits at the gate and takes care of everything immediately. We waited in the lounge for our onward flight to Kadhdhoo. After arrival, a short‚Ä¶"
"Travelling in these times is already a treat, but when you combine it with a stay at an outstanding resort like Six Senses Laamu, it is even more so!  There is a big push for environmental sustainability that you can feel across the operation. We were also lucky to witness a nest of turtles hatching right on the beach in front of the villas.  One of the highlights is the excellent F&B offering and particularly, Zen and Leaf restaurants are exceptional with original and tantalizing menus where we had memorable dinners.  The beach villa had all the necessary facilities and housekeeping was spotless.  Ali, our Guest Experience Manager was always one step ahead in anticipating our needs and the rest of the hosts were all charming and always ready to help.  "
"A long awaited dream come true. A visit to the Maldives in an over water villa like you see in every brochure and commercial on paradise. Anxious to see if it would live up to our expectations, we were amazed to experience our visit to Six Senses Laamu exceeded every one of them.  Marteyne and her staff, stuck on the island for six months or so (covid prevention) gave us a very warm welcome and were so hospitable and friendly throughout our stay.  Our GEM Ali was very helpful, showing us around, helping with reservations and getting the most out of our stay. Such a very nice person. Shifam our room attendant took excellent care of our villa. The people of the diving school with very knowledgeable instructors (Valerio and Hisham thank you) and the people of the Manta Trust,‚Ä¶"
"travel during covid can be stressful especially with an almost 3 year old, however, Marteyne and team helped remove any initial reservations we had before we arrived and were really responsive with all of the queries we had.  We were met at Male and had a really easy transfer to Six Senese despite the torrential downpour when we arrived!  Our ocean beach villa with pool was fantastic, views to the ocean to die for and the ‚Äúno shoes no news‚Äù beach chic vibe is exactly what we wanted after our previous visit to Gili Lankanfushi.  Our GEM Ali was absolutely fantastic, laid back but uber responsive a true gentlemen.  We needed up staying another night and this was all sorted seamlessly and Ali was always there when needed - I hope if we are lucky enough to return he is our GEM‚Ä¶"
"My husband and I went here for 10 days for our honeymoon and had an unforgettable celebration. My gem Edith made everything possible for us, hassle-free days, dinner bookings and activities in short granted every wish we had!   Our overwater villa is simply amazing, we‚Äôre in the mid of choosing to go outside or stay in the villa the whole time, this place is just perfect, escaping from the chaos of the world. It was quiet, peaceful and yet romantic. The most magical moment for us, seeing the dusk settled over the ocean at chill bar. Could be nicer if a nice music is on, a little bit of contemporary sound to tone with the moment.  I am sure for those looking for a romantic and relaxing break without frills you‚Äôll definitely enjoy this resort. Two thumbs up!!!! We‚Äôll be back!!!"
"From its overall sustainability concept to its attention to details, you can feel the effort they have put in to make your stay memorable. I like its local touch in its design and the food offering is rich. Everything is thought out for you so that you can simply enjoy your holiday."
Staff is excellent. Food - amazing. Yaga activities - perfect. Complimentary activities - very good. Very green and sustainable resort. Water villas look a little bit ugly from outside. Beach ocean villas are great especially if you have an open ocean view. Recommended! Very secluded. Excellent beds and bed sheets.  What I miss is a bar with cool live music.
"A big thank you to the entire team what an amazing trip we had. In these travel restricted times six senses offers the best and safest place to visit. The hotel is totally amazing and the staff too. All needs and requests totally catered for. Even to obtaining an item from the main island that we had forgotten. Above and beyond helpful. Our GEM Nasru  is a star, he looked after all eight of us so well. Accomodation amazing all food was tasty and great quality. Lots to do, or nothing but relax your choice. As we left dropping a small handful of white sand back into the ocean, a leaving  the hotel tradition guarantees we will be back.  "
"7 stars for this Paradise!!! Earlier this year, we stayed in this beautiful Island of Maldives. Thought of trying new place for a change, having longlist of resorts we finally came up with Six Senses Laamu still. Absolutely got the right pick once again! Excitement began when we had a 20-minute boat ride to get to the main island, greeted by management upon arrival, assigned experience manager walking us through our villa with views to die for. Cannot beat the food and setup, loved every meal we had, people are exceptionally polite and always willing to stop when you need help, full activities and so much more...All in all, still nothing compares to Six Sense Laamu, you deserved the loudest applause!!! Thoughts to ponder, DJ needs to formulate a better set of music not similar‚Ä¶"
"For those who want a more succinct review, I will be brief. Location, staff, food and villas will be very hard to beat anywhere in the world let alone the Maldives. Amazing, you have to go.   Out of adversity comes opportunity, it was that which lead our party of 8 to book this amazing resort in the Maldives. I was definitely lead by the reviews on here but also Six Senses does have an enviable reputation and we had been to a couple before.   Arrival at Male is by the six senses team and they whisk you away to get your connection to Laamu 40 mins later and you are whipped a cross the ocean in a well maintained fast boat with all the mod cons and a smart knowledgeable crew.  Then that's when the magic starts out of the ocean reminiscent of water world this rustic village appears‚Ä¶"
"Really good atmosphere at his island for all reasons, including the best beaches and the most friendly and competent staff. Nasru, our Gem was just five stars and we hope to be in touch again. Trully recommended. Joao"
"Just finished a 7 nights stay at Six Senses Laamu. What can I say... Probably the best hotel experience I‚Äôve ever had. The Maldives are a paradise but Six Senses elevates the standards.  Simple concept: luxury hotel, 5* service, wonderful food, outstanding service, barefoot life and a sustainability notion always present since the day you arrive until the day you leave. I‚Äôm already counting the days for our next visit!"
"Time sits still here and this place is so pristine, so private. There is a high attention to detail and everything is sustainable from means of transport (bicycle), staff uniform fabrics, building materials and food ingredients. No plastic in sight, clean and organic. Easy-going type of resort with bare feet walking as a standard. This was an unforgettable experience! Thanks to the staff for the services: spa (Lin) and gym (Bo and Hemant for yoga and meditation classes) and of course to our experience maker Nasru for taking care of us all this time."
"We had the most wonderful trip in my life ! I couldn‚Äôt have dreamt for a better holiday . All of the activities are amazing and the people working there are so helpful. The villas are perfection. Recommend for sure , I will come back next year hopefully !  Daniel was our GEM and really is a GEM üíé "
"I‚Äôm sure you could find something to find fault with SSL, but why would you try? The resort is outstanding by any measure.   The reviews before mine all compliment the staff. Quite rightly. Super friendly, professional and fun staff at every level make every experience an absolute pleasure. Have to single out Daniel (GEM who will take over the hotel world), CJ (Head Bartender who should know better to drink snake infused alcohol) and the girls from the spa (who would overtake cryptocurrency if they could be cloned), but each and every member of the team excelled and made you feel special.   The food in all restaurants was terrific and well covered in previous reviews. Was there a bad meal? No. If you are a big eater, small eater, fussy eater, you will be more than adequately‚Ä¶"
"We've just come back from Six Senses Laamu where we spent 7 unforgettable days and it was our best vacation ever. We even wanted to extend our stay, but due to pandemic and flights schedule it was unfortunatelly not possible. This is a real 5 star resort...in every aspect sustainable, luxurious, chic, charming and incredibly welcoming, with special attention to details and most of all to nature and environment.  We stayed in two different accomodations -ocean beach villa and lagoon water villa as we wanted to experience both, and there were both INCREDIBLE. Also, we are more then thankful to our GEM Daniel who was so kind and attentive all the time and really made our stay memorable and fabulous! He made us feel at home, as well as all stuff working on the island. They are all‚Ä¶"
"We‚Äôve just come back from Six Senses Laamu where we spent two wonderful weeks in one of the Sunset water Villas. We have stayed at Six Senses resorts in many other locations around the globe and consider Six Senses Laamu amongst the best. The food was very varied and excellently prepared and left nothing to be desired, even for vegetarians. The SPA as usual at Six Senses was one of a kind and so was the Diving experience. Staff was very friendly and attentive and made us feel at home. In short, the stay exceeded our high expectations and which were based on stays at other Maldives resorts such as Soneva Fushi. We will definitely be back! "
"This was the top tropical vacation of our lives (we‚Äôve been to Bora Bora, Tahaa, Bali, Vietnam) and can‚Äôt wait to return.  This is a barefoot luxury, sustainable chic resort where the sustainable aspect does not detract from the luxury one bit.  The experience is like no other where the staff has a sixth sense about what you need or would like.  Whatever we asked for was granted with love and a smile.  We changed one morning in 5 min from my husband doing to surf lesson to going diving and had to manage moving up our PCR test.  Our GEM (Guest Experience Maker), Nasru, made it possible with such calmness.  I injured my knee while at the resort and the doctor got special permission (during Covid) to go to the hospital on another island.  Nasru and another staff member accompanied‚Ä¶"
"We had the best stay every at Six Senses Laamu! The staff is so welcoming, helpful and friendly. We lived in the water villas at Jetty A and they were great. An amazing and spacious back yard area, where we spend most of our time!  The food was fantastic, at all the different restaurants. And lets not forget about the AWESOME breakfast and all the selections. You have a lot of different activities to choose from everyday, and a great gym and SPA. This is the place to go to if you are planing to visit the Maldives. Can¬¥t wait to come back!  And a special shout out to our GEM Arif, thanks a lot for all the great service!!"
"What a wonderful resort! Everything is perfect from beginning till the end. And it was so nice to forget about COVID, since the island/resort was free of the virus. We had an awesome GEM who took his best care of us (thank you Nasru!). Dining at Zen, Leaf and the Chill Bar were wonderful, food is fantastic. And breakfast is amazing, so many choices. We ate so healthy during our 12 days stay. Wellness/Spa was superb too. The overwater villa was supernice, everything was right and very thoughtfull. We were celebrating our 25th anniversary and we received such lovely treats. Many thanks to ALL the wonderful staff (just to name a few: Nasru, Hisham, Jacqu, Suat, Suhan, chef Marlon). We would love to be back."
"We had a beautiful stay at six senses Laamu, the staff is so welcoming and helpful (thank you Nasru & Afrah!!) - the island is beautiful, environmental friendly, with fantastic food and unique snorkelling with (when time allowed) - if you book a jetty villa would advise jetty C facing sunrise or jetty A. If you book a villa on the island, go for the sipsip side facing sunset. The marine biologists take fantastic care of the corals and animals, expect to see a lot of turtles, riff sharks or stingrays. Although the trip was for work, we left full of beautiful memories."
"After spending 10 incredible days on Six Senses Laamu, we‚Äôve decided to change to another island, which was a big mistake üò© any after just 4 days away we‚Äôve decided to extend our vacation and returned back to Laamu ‚ò∫Ô∏è in total we‚Äôve spent 20 days here and every day was fabulous! Especially the staff and the food are just great! OUR VILLA WAS always very clean and tidy up thanks to our RoomCleaner! Our GEM Ali managed everything for us with a nice smile on his face, before we‚Äôve even asked him! Special thanks to MINA, RAZAN, CJ, IRMAK, FruitGirl üòä, KADAM,  WARREN and everyone who works on this island! You made our stay incredible with a warm greeting and smile every single day!   The bicycles by the way are great to cycle around the island. And they are inspected every day‚Ä¶"
I came to the Maldives for the first time with my sister who has been to the six senses twice before and I understand why as it is just paradise.  Wonderful place üèùüê¢üê†üåä ü¶∂üèª Can‚Äôt recommend it highly enough  
"I travel extensively, both for business and pleasure, but rarely write reviews. However, after spending 11 unforgettable days at Six Senses Laamu, I cannot miss to share my feelings of this incredible experience.  We are mid- age family of 4, with 2 daughters, age 6 and 12. We decided to go to Maldives just a month ahead and jumped into looking different resorts (already went once a few years ago- W Maldives). Obviously when you are spending a five digit sum you are picky and a little but suspicious- is the resort of your choice going to live up to your dreams and expectations?   I am sure there are many top resorts in the Maldives but what makes Six Senses different and special is their attitude and attention- to nature, to environment, to you, to your kids.

We booked for 12 days and stayed 20 days.  This Six Senses beats any i have ever been to and we are counting the days already when we can return. Our GEM Shifu was exceptional and both her and the hotel thought of everything to make our stay unforgettable.
"Me and my family went to the Six Senses hotel a week ago. This was my first time being to the Maldives and all I can say is that our stay was incredible! First of all the team is really nice and helpful, the reef was amazing (we saw turtles, rayes, sharks and all sorts of fish). I went to a Biological Junior Course and it awesome! The whole resort was dedicated to the nature (no plastic), and the best thing was that everybody walked barefoot! Everything was incredible, I highly recommend to visit the Six Senses Hotel! :)"
"The sunrise, the sunset, the nightly strolls through a magical island. The over the water villa that surpassed our expectations. Six Senses Laamu was an absolute dream. It has become one of our favorite destination for pleasure, fun and enjoyment. Nasru was our GEM (guest experience manager. Nasru went above and beyond to make our stay more comfortable accommodating and made our first experience more memorable. Nasru your the best. If you ever go to six senses Nasru should be your go to go guy :). The staff is also so welcoming. I had the privilege to speak to the locals, bartenders, chefs and the amazing marine biologists. And let me tell you, the stories and history are endless. One of the coolest things I have seen is this resort besides everything else (haha)Is this football‚Ä¶"
"I‚Äôd like to thank all the team and especially our Gem Edith  for making our stay even more incredible than it could be üòç every minute we felt that we are cared about ü•∞  And the resort itself , the sustainability concept they carry deserves so much respect.

"We spent the last 1 week in Six Senses Laamu and it was just incredible. The best location on this planet. A real paradise. We stayed in a ocean water villa on jetty A. the villa was amazing and we enjoyed just staying on our private terrasse and going for a swim or snorkelling from there. We saw mind-blowing sunrises every day. Snorkelling is a real adventure and the house reef has an unbelievable variety of fishes. We saw sharks, turtles and rays almost every day. The food was just amazing in all of the 4 restaurants. Clearly 5 stars and kudos to the whole team. We loved the breakfast so much and it was the best way to start our day. They offer plenty of different dishes and fresh juices, so one week is almost too short to try everything on the menu. We recommend the French‚Ä¶"
"I had been dreaming of traveling to the Maldives for as long as I can remember and finally we went last November. As you can imagine I knew all resorts and we decided to go to Six senses and the summary is ¬®much better than expected"".  It has cost me a lot to write this opinion because I did not have the right words to do it.  Everything was special and spectacular: the place, the activities, the room (We were in an ocean beach villa with pool), the food and the most important the people. We spent 12 nights from 22 November 2020 to 5 December and we could have spent much more time and we are planning to be back very soon. I would like to have a special mention to our GEM  Arif that took care of every single detail during our stay and also to Ravah that took care of us when Arif‚Ä¶"
"We are a familly of 2 and a litlle 4 year old boy. We had the best time ever at Six Senses Laamu. The place itself is the king! Island is gorgeous and the natural richness  of the place and surroundings is incredible. Six Senses, the way if integrates  amenities, service and vibe to this magical place is almost unbelievable. Villas are suuuper confortable and every detail was thought off. All the staff, services, activities, regular and special meals and events, kids club, surfing, watersports are brought to us by a Guest Experience Manager (GEM). In our case, Daniel. He is a Star. Super kind and hiper helpfull always one step ahead of our needs and even our likes. He made everything flow in a magical way. Thank you Six Senses and especially, thank you Daniel."
"Six Senses Laamu exceeded our expectations in every way imaginable. The ambiance on the island is truly amazing and after having spent a few days there, we already felt as though we were at home. To start off, the service was impeccable and extremely welcoming. From the restaurants to your personal GEM, every single staff member did their best to accommodate all of our needs. The sincerity and passion of every member on the staff team made us feel very welcome. We would like to send our greatest praises to Mina, one of the resort‚Äôs managers. We stayed in the ocean water villa and in the ocean pool water villa. We loved the layout and design of both of the rooms, which included many amazing features such as the outdoor shower and the glass panels on the floor in certain sections‚Ä¶"
"We had the most amazing time at Six Senses Laamu a touch of paradise.  Myself and my 2 children Daniel and Christina got our padi certification with Valerio the Dive Instructor on incredible reefs.  Our GEM Aslah was the most accommodating person who made our holiday flow seamlessly.    Maasha was there for every breakfast making us wake up with delight. And Irumak made the kids smile each day with her animal shaped pancakes.  The Marine Biologist team Pip, Jas and Yamin taught the kids and ourselves so much about the ocean and its inhabitants and coral.  We extended our stay as we just didn‚Äôt want our holiday to end and we will definitely be returning.  Definitely Worth the onward flight from Male!"
"We had a wonderful family vacation at Six Senses Laamu. There are several things that we liked about the place ranging from great food, large and very comfortable family villa, awesome common areas and restaurants to the bare foot concept, stylish and thought through simplicity that mixes luxury, sustainability and privacy in a great combo. Our Guest Experience Manager  Nasru was super helpful in solving all kinds questions including getting flowers from Male / arranging for spices that my wife liked in a restaurant, etc. Our kids (4 and 7) loved the place. My wife and I loved the house reef that offered great snorkeling adventures. We met a few great couples with kids and all made good friends. Summing up in a few words - it was truly beyond expectations and we will be happy to‚Ä¶"
"We stayed here in April 2019 with our then 9 month old daughter and  it was our first trip to the Maldives. It was easily the best holiday we have ever had (and will likely ever have!) I'm not sure anyone could visit this place and not feel the same. The island is beautiful and the perfect size for getting around easily without feeling too small, and lots of vegetation which many resorts seem to lack. It is a true 5 star experience from the food, to the service,  and the standard of the rooms (we stayed in a laamu water villa). We were really pleased with the facilities they offered for an infant (bottle steriliser, high chair in room, complimentary food made to order and they would make pretty much whatever you asked for) which made our stay really easy. The resort is so well‚Ä¶"
"It's an incredible place - ideal to wind down. Outstanding spa with heavenly treatments, all super clean, excellent food and the most warm and welcoming staff you could imagine.  Great classes, some complementary  (e.g. yoga, art of breathing), great water sport center. Our over water villa was marvellous and we loved the outside shower.  Our wonderful guest experience manager went out of his way to make our stay unforgettable. A huge thank you to him and to our SPA therapists that helped us relieve the tensions of a stressful year 2020.  Very impressive and to us a most valuable aspect is the resort's strive for sustainability (starting with their own water in glass bottles and not stopping at locally grown food from their own garden) - a rare find in the Maldives. Noteworthy‚Ä¶"
"The hotel is situated in a very well protected atoll and the staff is just amazing. You can choose from so many activities and learn new things like diving or surfing. Picnic tour is a must! Trying all ice cream flavors they offer is also something to look out for, food and restaurants are amazing as well."
Six Senses Laamu is truly one of the most special places I've been lucky enough to visit. The words heaven on earth are not an overstatement. From the minute you step off the boat (free of your shoes!) everything is pure perfection.   The island is beautiful - we walked around it every morning at sunrise and snorkelled off the house reef countless times (a day!) - it has to be one of the best I've ever experienced in the Maldives. The marine biology team are so lovely and we enjoyed speaking to them about everything we had seen on our latest adventure.

"We had the pleasure of staying at Six Senses Laamu for three amazing weeks. From start to finish my experience was truly magical and I would honestly find it very hard to name a single fault. Every aspect of this resort surpassed every expectation that one would have when going to the Maldives. The food is utterly delish with a unique variety of dining options. My personal favourite was the lavender mash potato served at the leaf restaurant, I still can't stop talking about it.   Marteyne and her team are incredible (especially in our case Abdulla, who was out GEM)  and every single person that works there goes above and beyond to make sure that you have the most enjoyable stay. Everyone who works there is very friendly and there is never not a smile on their face.  I could not‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses Laamu is an exemplary example of a resort and as part of a leading worldwide brand,  that lives up to everything it and the brand stands for and promises to be. It is run by a GM who doesn‚Äôt miss a trick and from the top to the bottom, it is staffed by charming, efficient, smiling, friendly outstanding staff and this sets the resort apart from many we have been lucky enough to visit over the years. The GEM‚Äôs that are allocated to every guest act as your personal Butler and Abdulla who looked after us, was a GEM in every sense of the word.  Barefoot luxury with no pretensions, it works like clockwork and we have just returned from the holiday of a lifetime during a time when travel to these wonderful locations made it even more special. We will be back in 2022 and‚Ä¶"
"My wife and I had an absolutely incredible experience. Six Senses Laamu offers activities galore as well as plentiful opportunities for privacy. Our Guest Experience Manager was there for our every need and request which made the experience even more unique.  The staff in general are extremely friendly and courteous, I really enjoyed that. They strive to ensure the guests have the best experience.  The house reef is particularly beautiful, just off the edge of the main restaurant, and the food is pretty great.  I recommend morning fishing, where you can catch local fish and eat your catch! We caught a tuna and the chef prepared delicious sashimi!  Every small detail of this hotel is thoughtful and magical.  We will definitely be back! "
"We stayed for one week at Six Senses Laamu. It was a week in heaven, a week in paradise. The island is a true sanctuary. The natural beauty is overwhelming. Six Senses Laamu has the best house reef I have seen on the Maldives so far. Snorkeling and diving is a fairytale. SPA is a dream like always with Six Senses. The villas ar all spacious and quiet. We love the sustainable philosophy of Six Senses. The facilities are beautiful located (most over the water) and match perfect into the beautiful nature. The food was extraordinarie and the have special theme dining twice a week (mediterranean and asian food market). The best about the whole experience was the unbelievable Staff. They made us feel at home from day one. A huge thank to Tohihr (our GEM) he cared about us like‚Ä¶"
"I traveled to Six Senses Laamu in the Maldives for two weeks. I adored everything about my experience. I have traveled to 18 countries in total, and I have never been treated so well by staff at a place that I have stayed. Every single staff member is so kind, generous, and simply just amazing. Our GEM (Guest Experience Maker) Aslah, made our experience special by going above and beyond to ensure we always had what we needed and made special adjustments to things that we requested. Anything that you want he can make possible.   There are a variety of dinner restaurants to choose from, we loved Zen, the sushi place, and the chill bar which is beautifully designed. Each waiter was amazing, but we especially had an above and beyond experience with Raz who works in the chill bar. He‚Ä¶"
"I was in Laamu in 2019 and returned this January for one month. I had again the best best holiday of my life. Everything is perfect, starting first of all from the amazing staff and the General Manager. The kindness, happy smile, attention to details are incredible. The rooms all category are gorgeous, well kept and with beautiful details. The food is top quality. The spa , the yoga , the diving are top. Of course the atoll of Laamu is incredible beautiful but what it really makes this place are the people. I felt like at home and I‚Äôm terribly sad to leave. Thank you Six Senses Laamu for a wonderful wonderful stay! Giovanna Italy/UK"
"I have been to Six Senses Laamu a number of times now and it never fails to blow me away. The island is one of the most beautiful in the Maldives and the staff are incredibly helpful, friendly and go out of their way to make your stay the most special. The snorkelling is some of the best - you can go straight from your water villa to the magical colourful reef. The food is amazing and the different restaurants mean that you are spoilt for choice. I'm fail to be amazed by the sustainability initiatives that the management have put in place - Marteyne is a truly inspirational GM."
"Our first trip to Six Senses Laamu (December 2019) was so good we booked the exact same holiday for December 2020, just a few days longer. The second time was even better than the first: we all knew our way around, were so happy to find the same wonderful team there, and basically had spent all year looking forward to going back. Our boys this year were 7 and 10, and again loved it. Our 7 year old learned to surf (amazing instructors) and 10 year old became PADI certified for scuba diving (fantastic team at Deep Blue diving, thank you Danny, Stephen and Valerio). Again we had the best family time of our year and have booked to go back again december 2021, again for longer! We never do that, but this place and the people there are special."
Loved my stay here. Amazing staff and amenities. They are very conscious of the environment. Everything is eco friendly. Food is amazing. Many vegan and organic options. Great instructors. Amazing spa.
"Six Senses Laamu is a magical and special place. I have been going there for years. The simplicity and peace of the resort is incredible. There are certainly more ‚Äòbling‚Äô resorts in the Maldives, but I fear that people miss the point of travelling to these beautiful islands by staying in those places.  The rooms are a Robinson Crusoe fantasy, but with every creature comfort you might need. Unlike other resorts I have stayed in, you can actually swim in beautiful water from the over water villas.  Even when very full, you never get the sense that this is the case. There is enough space for everyone.  Some of the nicest and happiest staff I have encountered in the Maldives. Also the best General Manager in the country.  Marteyne is hands on in every sense of the word.  Cannot wait‚Ä¶"
"Probably the best resort visited in Maldives, everything absolutely fantastic, the design, the beach, the focus on sustainability, all the facilities, the food, the staff, particular thanks to Mrs Marteyne, Mr. Mina, Mr. Ganesh and Mr. Ali, your support was absolutely fantastic during the staying...  To be everything perfect, need only to change the aluminium capsules to the biodegradable coffee capsules in the rooms."
"This is without doubt the most special two weeks I‚Äôve ever had. The family community is second to none. Every member of staff from the top to the bottom is kind, thoughtful, helpful, and performed the best service I have ever experienced. They adapted menus in every restaurant to suit our dietary needs and did it without any sign it being too much of a trouble.  Not only this we felt comfortable and safe knowing we were having our temperature taken every morning so that our safety and the safety of others, was at the upmost importance of the resort.  Des Mitchel the DJ made every evening special with his awesome taste in music while we ate the most delicious food. All while being barefoot and living our best lives!

"The 5 days experience at Six Senses Laamu has been truly amazing and dream come true. The breeze was so soothing and the atmosphere was also like living in heaven. What‚Äôs more extraordinary was the service at Six Senses. All the staff were very nice and friendly especially my GEM Emma, she has been very caring, thoughtful and professional as well, she reminds me of the things I forget easily and book itenarary in a manner that makes sense fir what I like within my timeline. She catered for my personal trip here. Such a great time here. I recommend everybody come here!"
"I stayed in Maldives with my family for 3 weeks from December 24, 2020. During our stay we visited 3 hotels Ozen Reserve Bolifushi, Six Senses Laamu and Joali.   We chose Six Senses Laamu because last year we had a chance to visit Six Senses Yao Noi in Thailand and we loved it.   We did not like Six Senses Laamu since arrival. We didn‚Äôt feel relaxed there. We felt like we joined to some closed community that lives by its own rules.   First of all you have to take off your shoes because hotel is bearfoot. If you go to public toilet in restaurant zone you do not wear shoes what in my opinion is disgusting and not hygienic.   My 6 yo daughter burned her feet because of hot jetty.   Secondly, the resort has its own time zone +1h. Again they dictate people to wake up ealier to have‚Ä¶"
"It was a long way to the Six Senses but it was worth it! We had a wonderful time with our kids (9y+10y). My husband and our son did the PADI and my daughter went to the Marine Biology class where she had the possibility to go snorkelling. All the 3 restaurants are very good, especially the Leave and Zen. The Spa ever have been.  Our GEM (Guest Experience Manager) Emma was such a lovely person! Her work was great. She helped and supported us a lot. And such a positive person! Thank you!"
"We stayed here in February 2020 just before COVID. We had an absolutely amazing time! The service here is top notch, thanks to the very talented GM Marteyne. Many of the staff mentioned to us that she makes people want to work there and locals are treated better than at any other resorts. This is apparent in the engagement of the staff and the level of service we received. We loved all of the fun and special touches the resort provides - the ice cream shop, the restaurant overwater hammocks, the bicycles to get around the island. We are avid divers and dove every morning; we were lucky enough to spot several manta rays. This is a place where you can truly unwind and relax. Yes, it is pricey, but yes, it is worth it.

"My husband and I spent 6 nights at Six Senses Laamu.  We could not have been happier with the service, the room set up and the property.  Our trip was the perfect mix of luxury and privacy for the ultimate relaxing pandemic vacation.  The property naturally lends itself to social distancing.  We stayed in Villa 44 at the end of Jetty B.  We were perfectly ‚Äúisolated‚Äù here and enjoyed the most expansive and uninterrupted views.  There was a beautiful reef right outside our villa where we could see fish, turtles and rays while snorkeling.  We felt completely safe at the resort as a whole ‚Äî the staff wore masks, masks were required by all in the very few indoor spaces, temperatures were taken daily and restaurant tables were very well spaced out.  Our GEM, Aslah, made us feel so‚Ä¶"
"If I could give this 10 stars I would. Everything from  the wonderful Guest Experience Manager who tended to all our needs with a smile at all times to the wonderful diving and snorkelling, brilliant over water villa with endless views of the reef surpassed all our expectations.  We are experienced travellers world wide and can honestly say this was the best holiday we have ever had.  The dining in each of the restaurants was immaculate and the Leaf and Zen dinners were of two star Michelin standards! All this in a paradise of utter relaxation and super friendly and competent staff.  No more need be said and we will be back COVID allowing  AN  London"
"This was a return visit to the same hotel after we enjoyed the first experience very much.We had three overwater villas on jetty C. We were able to compare the offering from a previous non-Covid period experience and frankly found it better than the first! From logistics arrangements-( you take a short plane and boat ride to get to the island from Male) to check in it was a first class seven stat experience.The food, food choices and restaurant service was superlative.  This is seven star experience without the ‚Äúbling bling‚Äù- just the way to have a holiday.The island is small and has a pristine and stunning house reef.The snorkelling is superb. We are avid divers and used the services of the dive centre which again was a better experience than our first visit. The test of any‚Ä¶"
"My 11 year old daughter and I celebrated Christmas and New Years in Laamu. It was without doubt the best holiday we‚Äôve ever had. The staff at Six Senses go out of their way to make sure their guests experience the full extent of what the Maldives has to offer - pristine beaches, amazing snorkeling and diving, and magical ecology and wildlife. Everything (pancakes shaped like sea turtles, the most delicious French rose wine, the bicycles the guests get to peddle around the island on) is done immaculately with the greatest degree of care and without any detail overlooked or spared. We‚Äôre looking forward to coming back again and again."
"Our Butler/Guest Experience Manager was Abdulla Hassan who we can't speak highly enough of. He got to understand immediately what we needed, nothing was ever a problem, he would always sort out requests 'off menu' with no fuss, a big smile and timely."
"Fantastic scenery, relaxing atmosphere and a very high attention to details, plus the feeling to be unique in a very beautiful environment. Tasty food and very attentive stuff. Ideal place for vacations!"
"I could start by saying how beautiful the island is, how breathtakingly picturesque the beaches are and how authentic the whole experience is. But instead I want to emphasize how brilliant the six senses laamu team is. Half the experience is due to the island‚Äôs natural beauty but the other half is attributed to the people working for your daily comfort and excitement. It is unbelievable how much more beautiful a resort like the six senses laamu can become just by adding some of the friendliest, most heart warming employees I‚Äôve ever come in contact with. From Mina, to Thohir, to JC, to Haishem, to Hassan, to Abdullah, to Chef Modex, and Chef Marlon, everyone of my encounters was special and everyone of them left a warmth in my heart i will take with me into the new year.

"I travelled to Six Senses Laamu with my boyfriend and it was my first time in the Maldives. Six Senses Laamu is the most beautiful place with white sand, extremely blue water and the most cozy villas. The staff are very friendly and assisted us with every question we had during our stay.  Me and my boyfriend travels a lot, and what we really appreciated with six senses laamu is that we were provided with a personal guest manager when we arrived. Our guest manager gave us his WhatsApp and we could contact him at any time during our stay. It felt very personal and professional to have our own guy taking care of us.

"First time in the Maldives and first experience with Six Senses, was the trip of my life! The balance between a luxury hotel services and a friendly/ warm atmosphere is absolutely brilliant. Would definitely recommend for couples as well as families. The people looking after you on the island are fantastic, very professionnal and genuinely kind. Beyond the strictly luxurious environment of the place, the amount and the quality of experiences available  - yoga, spa, private island, snorkeling with a marine biologist, mini submarine (seabob)- are trully phenomenal and of very high standards. Thanks again to our wonderful Guest Experience Manager - Arif - for making this holiday the best of my life :)"
"Super chill hotel with a clear sustainable angle but that does not compromise on luxury. The best was the personal guest manager who took care of us throughout the trip using WhatsApp and the unbelievable snorkelling. We saw turtles, sharks and outside our water villa."
"We spent 6 days of our express honeymoon in Six Senses Laamu, and our experience was just amazing! Although Six Senses can seem to be a bit far apart, having to take a domestic flight the place is just incredible, away from everything, and it is definitely worth it!   Transfer: The reservations team (an in particular Shaania Ahmed to whom we are super thankful for having organised everything for us in record time!) took care of booking the local flight and arranged all the transfers. Everything was super easy and smooth   we had a member of the hotel crew welcome us in Male Int Airport, take us to the local flights terminal and arranged for us to stay in the VIP room.

We thought we knew what to expect from a friend who had stayed there multiple times, but we were blown away by the attention to every detail, large and small, covered by the resort team. Our expectations were exceeded time and time again!  When you arrive to the resort you are assigned to a GEM (Guest Experience Manager) who will assist you with reservations for restaurants, spa treatments, classes, or any of the many experiences offered.

"We honeymooned at Six Senses last month and we could not recommend it more highly. For two weeks we time travelled to a pandemic free world of 2019, in a truly blissful setting. We‚Äôre already planning a return visit.  What made it so special? Firstly, the resort landscaping and accommodation are both sublime. All public spaces are beautiful and immaculately kept; with so many spaces to play and relax. We loved the swim-up bar at Sip Sip and afternoon cocktails in an overwater hammock at Chill Bar are a must. We loved the natural feel in the rooms - almost everything being wooden; outdoor bathrooms and large, spacious terraces rooms to enjoy the ocean view by day and incredible stars by night.  We were a little dubious about having a GEM before travelling; we prefer our holidays‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses Laamu offers world class diving and that was our primary reason for coming! The dive center took amazing care of us: getting us safely out and back to experience pristine healthy corals, plethoras of schooling fish, and daily turtle sightings along with majestic mantas and rays!   But here‚Äôs where our vacation took an interesting turn... Little did we know that what we actually needed was going to be provided by Six Senses Laamu! Rejuvenating spa treatments, unforgettable sunsets, fun bike rides around the island, and luxurious barefoot luxury accommodations... this resort provided us with so much more that what we had originally sought out: to feel restored and renewed after a long year.

In all my wanderings, I‚Äôve never found a place that‚Äôs at once so luxurious and charmingly unpretentious. The service, the cuisine, the environs, and in these strange times, the attention to safety for guests and staff alike all make Six Senses Laamu a brilliant standout in the sea of luxury lodgings on offer in the Maldives.

"The pool villa was superb - direct access to the ocean and great area for sunbathing complemented with our own pool for when we needed to cool down. The ocean view gave us such a boost of joy and amazement every morning - followed by a superb breakfast with a stunning sea view setting. How amazing to be able to just leave breakfast and go for snorkel dive on the house reef just meters away and teaming with fish and corals. The scuba facilities were brilliant as were the instructors and the dive sites provided more than we could have dreamed of.

But we know that all of this cannot function without exceptional management - so thank you GM Martine - you and your team‚Ä¶"
"We have visited the Maldives on numerous occasions and stayed at some great hotels so probably better placed to make a comparison.  The property is optically quite pretty. We had one of the water villas which is nicely laid out. The water villas are quite close to one another and privacy is not ideal. As we were there during Xmas period, there was quite a few children and you could hear the noise from the next villa. In addition, many children where running around in chill bar to the annoyance of many guests.

It is unquestionably a beautiful five star resort, with great service, and outstanding food at several venues, but I really enjoyed how everything is presented and conducted in a relaxed, barefoot, ride your bicycle everywhere environment.

"My husband and I just spent 34 days at Six Sense Laamu. A stunningly beautiful resort, beautiful buildings and grounds where we were treated to amazing food and diving. It is also the safest I've felt since this whole pandemic began . Every person visiting Laamu must have a negative Covid test to be able to visit. While you are there, your temperature is taken everyday to ensure you stay healthy . Staff health is imperative as well. If a staff person leaves the island for any reason, they remain in quarantine per health guidelines until they are cleared. Strict guidelines have been established for staff when they are off duty as well. There are hand washing stations throughout the island. Dining and activities are outdoors and in open air. The only time you need wear a mask is‚Ä¶"
"We had high expectations of Six Senses and the experience we had was even better!! Great service from all of the staff and an amazing, relaxing and beautiful environment. We saw lots of fish, turtles, sharks abs stingrays. Would love to be able to go back. Unforgettable!"
"I found this place incredible. The service was outstanding and genuine, particularly from Arif and Ravah, our personal ""butlers"", as well as the surf and kitesurf instructors. To which point, how many places in the world can you surf AND kitesurf, in stunning conditions?! Amazing. The food ranged from good (the Japanese) to great (breakfast, and Leaf restaurant). The culture of the company/resort really felt amazing, like management really did care about delivering a sustainable enterprise, both economically and environmentally. I am not a resort person really, and NEVER go back to the same resort twice, but I would go back here in a heartbeat. It's like a five star luxury resort for the sort of active people who also love to go backpacking. Bravo, Six Senses, bravo."
"Six Senses Laamu is just HEAVEN ON EARTH! I can't even begin to put into words how amazing the resort is, from the interiors, idyllic scenery, food and staff. We have only been home for 1 night, and I am already counting down the days until we are back!   The staff are what really make this resort exceptional, we have made friends for life and there were even some tears upon departure!   I just want to say a special thanks to our GEM (guest experience maker) Daniel, who made our stay very memorable. Apart from dealing with my day to day requests, Daniel also organised for my fiance to play football several times with hotel staff which was a major highlight to his trip. @Dani - if you see this, we miss you dearly and it wont be the last time that we cross paths I am sure, you are‚Ä¶"
We stayed for 8 nights in a water villa and had a magical stay. Great choice of dining and beautiful views from all corners of the island with the most amazing sunsets. All our needs were met with our fantastic GEM Aslah! Would come back in a heartbeat!
"Six Senses Laamu was an absolute dream come true. It is now our favorite resort we have ever visited because of the Six Senses staff and property. The staff went above and beyond to make sure we were happy and that every part of our stay was perfect. The property is exceptional and the service and the food and were beyond our expectations. We stayed in two different room accommodations by choice and each of them was better than the last! The attention to detail on this property is second to none. Our GEM (guest experience manager) Ravah was absolutely fabulous. He is kind, attentive and always assured we had everything we needed! This resort took covid 19 precautions to make sure we always felt comfortable and we never felt worried at all! The resort was spotless and clean and‚Ä¶"
"We just spend 7 days at the resort. The food is excellent, service good and resort beautiful. However, we were surprised when we were told to take off our masks and everyone working there were neither wearing masks nor practicing social distancing. Buffet continues, staff talking (without masks) while handling food etc. We felt uncomfortable, if any of the guest or staff has covid, it could potentially spread to everyone else in the resort. A negative pre departure Covid-19 test 4 days before your flight to Maldives is required, however, the traveler could still catch it after the test or be contagious after the test. In other Maldives resorts, the guests were not required to wear masks, however all the staff are."
"The service, accommodation, food, set-up & guest experience is like nothing I have ever experienced before.  Completely faultless, would go back in a heartbeat - utterly exceptional. Couldn't recommend more highly."
My fiance and I went to Six Senses Laamu in November and it was hands down the most luxurious and relaxing trip we've ever taken. Six Senses thinks of every single detail from the pillows to the personalised bikes and so much more. The food is also out of this world. We were expecting the food to be good after reading the reviews but we didn't expect it to be THAT good. We live in London and have been to our fair share of nice restaurants but one of our meals at Zen was easily one of the best meals we've ever had.  The breakfast is also ridiculously delicious and everything you could ever want is included.   Our GEM Shifu was the absolute best. She checked in on us the perfect amount without being at all overbearing. She was incredibly kind and helpful and really made our trip.‚Ä¶
It was the best hotel that I have been in my life. Everything was perfect. I recommend everyone to come and enjoy this amazing paradise. I will come back as soon as possible. Thanks so much SIX SENSE LAAMU
"Our girls trip to Six Senses Laamu was hands down the best of 2020! Incredible once-in-a-lifetime stay.   The staff spared no effort to make us feel welcome and cherished. We felt we were visiting a family, one that anticipated our every need and dream. Marteyne the GM was incredible as head of the family, and Abdulla our GEM really defined the term ‚ÄúGEM‚Äù (general experience manager- one of a kind). We had a birthday celebration on the beach that I will never forget!  The food was absolutely incredible. I maintain a strict no dairy, no gluten and no egg diet and not once did I feel out of place. The head Chef Stefan is a pure genius, and all the staff know the dishes so well it‚Äôs incredible. The taste was phenomenal every day, and having organic locally grown herbs was such a‚Ä¶"
"Our stay at Six Senses Laamu was just amazing! The whole resort is well maintained and their effort in being sustainable is impressive. We also enjoyed to have a better inside look by all the activities they offered during the day like a ""back of the house tour"" or the presentations held by marine biologist like Jas.  What impressed us most was the outstanding hospitality of the whole Six Senses Laamu team. Not only their professionalism, but also their openness and friendliness made our stay complete! Aslah, our GEM, made us feel home from the first second on until we had to leave this beautiful place again. During the day we were busy exploring great dive sites with our excellent dive guide Danny and the rest of the crew, having an excellent massage by Som and Chhem or‚Ä¶"
"We spent 7 nights here at a Laamu water villa and I must say that everything was excellent. The location of the resort is in a unique area where you can enjoy so many excursions like surfing, snorkeling and ect. Our GEM ( Shifu ) was so nice and lovely, and she makes wonderful experience for us during our stay. hope to be back very soon!"
"The stay was really wonderful, and all facilities (food and water sports included ) are high quality and customner oriented. Over water villages are really outstanding, perfect for snorkelying and really luxury. Up-to-date COVID measures and nothing to worry about.. No excuse for not retuning!!"
"After a lot of research, we finalised Six Senses as our honeymoon destination. Coming from India, we have to admit we were a little skeptical since this property is not frequented a lot by Indians, but right from the time we arrived at the Male airport, till our departure from the villa - we had an un-wordly experience! Our GEM - Afrah - is the most helpful soul on this planet, making sure all our needs were fulfilled. He even arranged for a sugarcane drink session specially for us when we told him we were excited to have it. Both of us are vegetarians and my wife strictly eats Jain food (no root vegetables). So when it took them a meal or two to figure her taste bud preferences, Afrah very kindly introduced us to Chef Pema - who was spot on in arranging us all our meal‚Ä¶"
"We visited Six Senses Laamu to get away from all covid-drama and cold from Spain, and we found not only the perfect scape but the real paradise. The place was already here, but the people that works here make the rest to make our stay magical. We will come back, for sure."
"It‚Äôs difficult to find the appropriate superlatives to describe how incredibly wonderful Six Senses Laamu is ! After spending a whole month soaking up the most amazing time in paradise I shall try to articulate what makes Six Senses the best of the best in the Maldives. Firstly the ethos and ideals of this resort are spot on with regards to protecting the environment and promoting self sufficiency and sustainability, the luxurious barefoot regime is perfectly married to these principles. Secondly the staff who look after your every need and requirement are perhaps some of the most professional ,polite and friendly people that I have ever had the pleasure of encountering. The staff come from many different countries but gel brilliantly as a team and literally nothing is too much‚Ä¶"
"After a month staying here I think I‚Äôve died and gone to heaven . My 5th visit in the Maldives but definitely the best! All the islands are beautiful but what really made it here was the staff . Aslah , Abdula , Shark, CJ to mention a few. Delicious food , beautiful villas . Amazing experience . I could go on and on . This has to be my favourite place on earth ."
"Tldr; just come here. The service, food, villas, spa, island, snorkeling and experiences are out of this world. We came in as guests. We left feeling like family.   Long version. My boyfriend and I visited Six senses for a total of 2 weeks in late November to early December. I‚Äôve done a breakdown of all the different aspects and highlights of our trip.   Service: the hosts go out of their way to make sure you feel comfortable and tended to. One thing we noticed is how everyone is genuinely happy here. We always saw a smile. And it‚Äôs because the hosts are treated extremely well and taken care of by the hotel. Happy hosts = happy guests. We got to know the individual bartenders and waitstaff at each restaurant. We wanted to give a personal shout out to Ansar! We loved your‚Ä¶"
"This place is special. The magic setting, the impeccable yet unobtrusive service, the genuine kindness of all the hosts... All of it.   Six Senses executes the ""barefoot luxury"" ethos perfectly, delivering at a world class level in every area.   For anyone who enjoys a healthy lifestyle, clean food, and environmentally-friendly practices, this place is for you. Food is mostly organic and sourced locally (greens and herbs from their own garden, eggs from their own chickens, etc), the air is clear, and the spa and wellness treatments were the best I've ever experienced anywhere. Special shout out to Som and Pema for working out kinks in my legs and back that had been there for years from old athletic injuries. They are truly healers. Janice the spa manager, Emma the yoga‚Ä¶"
"We spent 5 nights at Six Senses. I had very high expectations since I had already stayed at another Six Senses hotel (Douro Portugal), but Laamu went beyond all those expectations: 1) the food is amazing. The executive chef is very detailed oriented and will make sure you have excellent meals. Breakfast has an extensive menu and the quality of ingredients is superb. Alvina is the chocolate expert and leads a chocolate tasting session (six senses produces their own chocolate, bean to bar). The chef at the pancakes counter during brekfast is so friendly and makes pancakes with different shapes such as turtles, crab, octupus - so much dun 2) Staff is very friendly - once you get there you will be introduce to the team. The team will be alll there for you to say goodbye as well.‚Ä¶"
"Amazing Resort. Our stay was perfect.  From the reception at Mal√© airport to our Departure everything and everyone from Six Senses did an excellent job to make our stay as pleasurable as possible. Beautiful location; wonderful and comfortable bangal√¥; all the possible options of water-sports and diving locations; quiet and beautiful beach for just relaxing in sun. Whatever you want to do, you will be more then satisfied at six senses.  Our GEM, who takes care of you during your stay did a impeccable job.   And what about the food? Amazing! A Michelin level chef do an amazing job providing options for every taste and preferences.   Hope we can get back soon!!!"
"My family and I visited the property and really enjoyed every aspect of the experience. Having stayed at the chains property at Krabi and Bhutan ‚Äì we can surely say that this experience lives up to their chains reputation.  I loved the concept of barefoot living encouraged right from the moment we step onto the boat that gets you to the island. Upon arrival, we were introduced to our GEM (guest experience manager) Daniel who was great! For the duration of the stay ‚Äì he took care of scheduling all our bookings and requests including booking our PCR tests and procuring some wild flowers for our Diwali puja.  As someone who can‚Äôt cycle it was definitely overwhelming in the beginning but they got me a tricycle ‚Äì which was very comfortable. While you can always call a buggy, it does‚Ä¶"
"Six senses is a place I'll never forget. My first impression upon arriving there was ""WOOOW"" and ""I don't want to leave this place"". Since during my trip to the Maldives I visited a sufficient number of other resorts, I can safely say that there is no such place as Six Senses. Every day you feel like you're in a dream that you don't want to wake up from. I completely fell in love with the philosophy of ""no news no shoes"", which is so necessary for people to detox from the hustle and bustle of life,  especially now with the situation in the world. Incredible water villas where you can see all the underwater life. Every meal was like a holiday, especially my favorite restaurant was ""Leaf"". Cycling has always brought pleasure and a sense of reconnection with nature. As well as the‚Ä¶"
"It was the best experiencie i have ever had in my entire life! Thank you so much six senses for this amazing time! I Can‚Äôt wait to come Back!! Thank you to my GEM Aslah, to the good reception of Hahsaan in Sip Sip and also to Rana for making me the best pancankes!"
"Our GEM, Daniel, was exceptionally great. He made us feel welcome and a part of the Six Senses family.   I also want to recognize Pip Roe, our dive master and the head of the marine biology at the resort. She was outstanding in both dive safety, making us feel comfortable, and showing us much of what the beautiful ocean and reefs of the Maldives has to offer.  The staff of the resort really does a great job of making you feel welcome and included. They go out of their way to help you with any need you may have.  We tried to capture the names of those at the resort who did something special for us during our time at the resort. Their names are below.  Mahit Ansaar Shahu (Shark) Hisham Shifu  Basically, if you want to experience what I would consider to be a very special, tropical‚Ä¶"
"I‚Äôm a documentary filmmaker who travels the world for a living, and I can safely say I have never spent time in a place as peaceful, breathtaking and intimate as Six Senses. There is really no combination of words that could adequately describe the feeling of living inside those water villas and being surrounded by exotic sea creatures of all kinds - or the feeling of walking barefoot in the soft sand and realizing that your problems from the world you left behind are truly inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. I recently made two separate trips to Six Senses Laamu while filming a tourism film for CNN and the Maldives Tourism Board, and the memories I made here have been among the most beautiful of my entire career. Every smiling face, every epic meal, every colourful‚Ä¶"
"We've just returned from our second stay at Six Senses Laamu.  We had the absolute pleasure of staying 6 years ago on our honeymoon.  When we realized the Maldives were open to tourists again, we booked immediately!  The experience begins and ends with Marteyne greeting you at the dock and finally bidding you adieu at the end of your stay.  As the general manager of the resort, she takes personal responsibility in ensuring that your stay is absolutely perfect and that is reflected in the interactions you have with every single team member you interact with.  I have never been to a resort where literally every person is as intensely focused on creating a perfect stay for you as at the Six Senses Laamu.  Our GEM (guest experience maker), Shifu was a dream.  ""No"" was simply not in‚Ä¶"
"We had ine of the best esperance in six sense Laamu . Our GEM , Abdulla took a very good care to make our dream come true. The food was amazing ! We got a photograph there , her name is Liana, She is also great!!   All people from six sense are very friendly. Feel like Home in the paradise"
"We were one week in Six Senses Lamuu for our honeymoon and the stay was amazing! The island is a paradise and the hotel offers lots of activities: snorkel, massages, yoga, etc. The food in the 4 restaurants is excellent and the breakfast buffet absolutely amazing. We forget shoes and watches for a week. If you want to disconnect of the city don‚Äôt hesitate to come and enjoy here."
"My partner and I booked this as a real last minute treat for his 30th and a way to get away from all of the misery this year has brought.   We couldn‚Äôt have gone anywhere more idyllic. The Maldives were always going to be magical but it‚Äôs the staff and the setting at the Six Senses that really make the whole experience extraordinary.   Firstly, the food. We can hand on heartedly say that this is the best food we‚Äôve ever experienced. The chef deserves all the credit he can get. They combine the fresh flavours of their own garden with the local delicacies to give you an out of world experience that excites your senses. It‚Äôs just perfect in every way. We did a private dining experience in the wine cellar which was well worth paying extra for. The sommelier, Dinesh, has a wealth of‚Ä¶"
"After many life-delays, including COVID, my wife and I were finally able to go on our Honeymoon and after loads of research on the best resorts in the Maldives, settled on Six Senses Laamu. It was definitely the right decision and the entire vibe perfectly fit our personalities. The ""barefoot eco-luxury"" theme definitely gives a unique feel to the resort and was very relaxing. You get assigned a GEM upon arrival and in our case, Abdulla went above and beyond in making sure our honeymoon was exactly how we imagined. A myth that was dispelled for us was the notion that we'd be bored being ""stuck"" on the island. There was an endless list of activities and we definitely wished we could have stayed longer than the 5 nights we stayed to experience more.  It was also a very nice‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses Laamu, Maldives, the perfect vacation  First trip to the Maldives after a ton of research, went for a renewal of vows (8 years of marriage) and since we didn‚Äôt exactly have a honeymoon at the time, this one was it.  Perfect from the beginning, they pick you up at the airport in Mal√© and take you and your luggage (which you will only see again in your room) to the waiting area with AC and refreshments (water and coffee). After about 45 minutes we took a commercial flight to Kadhdhoo airport (45 minutes), there someone else took us to the speed boat. Took off our shoes and only put them on again when we left, not even flip flops. It‚Äôs a very freeing experience, we didn‚Äôt worry about splints, and floor is very clean. We were greeted by staff upon arrival and assigned a‚Ä¶"
"Dream comes true in Six Senses Laama. Thanks to all staff, specially to Shifu that she help us to enjoy our holiday to maximum. Relax, peace and fantastic food! Spa was as well amazing, yoga in perfect place with beautiful view."
"My husband and I visited the Maldives for the first time to celebrate our honeymoon. COVID has caused so many uncertainties this year, but we were determined to celebrate! All of our stress and anxieties from the past 8 months disappeared the minute we set foot on this beautiful island resort! This was the reset that we needed and were so sad to go! The staff were so attentive to our needs and made our days effortless. We stayed in an ocean water villa with a pool off of Jetty A and could not believe our luck to have turtles, stingrays, and the most colorful fish right underneath us. Each morning we were greeted with a beautiful sunrise followed by a morning snorkel - absolute heaven! Not only were we wowed with the accommodations and marine life, but the resorts restaurants and‚Ä¶"
We could have picked a more beautiful place with beautiful people. Six senses was not a 5 star resort. It was 10 stars!! We would not hesitate to go again and recommend to anyone who asks. What such great memories.
My husbands & i arrived to six senses laamu to spend our honeymoon..this was our first visit to Maldives..everything in this resort is amazing..from foods to activities we love everything..this place is like a heaven..all the staffs are very well trained & can always feels the genuine smile on there faces..Special thanks to Aslah who made us feel like royals..we will see you guys soonü§©ü§©

Plenty of options for snorkeling & other activities..all the staffs from bars to restaurants were always Very helpful..I must governo specific mention of one particular staff who clearly standart outros from the rest! & That os outros GEM Aslah who was absoulutely amazing & who made our stay excepsional..canto wait to come back again.. thankyou sixsense Laamu!
"If you are thinking to spend your vacay here, DO IT NOW!!  This was our second time in Six Senses Laamu, first 3 years ago as couple and this time with our plus 1 and half year old daughter.  And it is still  hard to describe this place - the experience, staff and food is nothing less than perfection. The expectation for this time were quite high as we have already experience the magical Six Senses Laamu. And of course, they exceeded.  I will divide my review into 3 - pre arrival, stay and back home.  1) Let's start with the experience before you vacation actually starts. The attention that reservation office provides is outstanding (the amazing Shaania couldn't provide a better service  - a huge thank to her patience and time).  We booked our trip when the first lockdown‚Ä¶"
"six senses laamu is amazing. starting with the people and the team who work there - service in restaurants and bars is excellent - the dive center is world class, the surfing lessons are superb with a world class break just a few moments away. not to forget the spa and the great people working there. the water is crystal clear every day, and the beach can only be described as paradise like. all contributing to being one of the most special places on this planet."
"Our trip to Six Senses Laamu was unbelievable! Is the best experience we have ever had, thank you so much Ravah, you are the best. You mad everything possible for us, every detail was amazing.  This is resort is really amazing, they make everything possible for our planet and our body. Sustainable and Organic are the priorities of this resort.  Peace and Calm are everywhere in this Resort!  Thanks to everyone in the resort ( general manager, gem, chefs, bartenders, waitress, etc ) Everyone, absolutely everyone, was really nice people who can you talked and they will treat you as family.  This resorts make everyone feel happy so the guests treat other guests as family.  By the way, they have free ice cream everyday at every hour.  Who doesn‚Äôt love ice cream?"
Amazing restaurants. Huge list of very cool activities to do! Extremely nice staff. When you arrive you get asign a GEM to help you during your stay and it is so useful! Ours was called Shifu and she did a great job! The location and the atmosphere of the resort are extraordinary. It has all the details you can think about! We will definitely come back!!!
"This was our third visit to Laamu and I actually think the best. We were quite nervous about travelling during a pandemic but Six Senses made us feel happy and safe at all times. Laamu is the most beautiful and relaxing place and we were so well looked after. We stayed in a Laamu water villa with pool on jetty a, and spent an amazing two weeks relaxing, snorkelling and eating delicious food. Our GEM Arif was great at sorting anything out for us and Rava also. The management team were very present throughout our stay and happy to help with any concerns. I hope we will be back again soon.

"Been here for our honeymoon in 2016 and have been dying to come back since. Well, we did now in Oct 2020 and even though it was our 2nd time here it felt like the first. This place is paradise, everything from service to rooms to food to activities is perfect. Everyone one in six senses laamu is amazing and will do everything out of their way to make your stay the best possible, there is nothinh that cant be done. Our GEM Aslah was always ahead of us in thinking of ways to make our stay even more pleasant. The best.

As a plus, I surf and although the surf is still the same (amazing), now the‚Ä¶"

Special mention to Marlon the chef at Zen the Japanese resto who created such an exquisite culinary experience every time... Our guide Aslah was super fantastic also, making sure the whole experience is stunning, checking in on us all the time making sure we are happy... Simply extraordinary place, community, and experience"
"As our vacation to a Six Senses Laamu winds down, I am reflecting on how truly great this place has been. If you are considering the Maldives and looking for your accommodation, you MUST stay with S.S.Laamu.   Service is at the forefront of their existence. From the moment you book, to your trip here, to your arrival, everyday life, and departure. I have never experienced such absolute top notch service. You are given a person to look after you, provide suggestions for places to eat and experiences to book, called a GEM. This person is your go to and has your back for everything. Huge shoutout to Aslah, our GEM, who made sure our experience was second to none. Every staff member greets you, is there to help you with anything you need (even if it isn‚Äôt their job), and will always‚Ä¶"
"we chose to spend our honeymoon in the maldives due to the beautiful landscapes, climate and clean, clear waters that we have seen so many times in photos and videos. since our arrival at the male airport our reception at the sixsens was incredible, and from then on we were delighted not only by the beautiful beaches and the traditional village, but also by the best treatment we have ever received. sixsens lammu is sensational from start to finish, people are extremely attentive, polite and kind all the time. we had the pleasure of having as our GEM the friendly and attentive Aslah which by the way in my opinion is the best GEM. Everything is perfectly weighing for your wellbeing and comfort all the time. it's amazing how caring and caring people are, what makes you feel at home‚Ä¶"
"we chose Six Senses Laamu to relax on our honeymoon but the resort and the trip exceeded our expectations! In addition to the unspeakable beauty of the Blue paradise, the food, the various activities the hotel offers are awesome! I can't help talking about the affection and care that all hotel employees have at all times so that the holidays are the best we could have, starting with our GEM ASLAH, who took care of every detail in our vacations, the boys from the Pool : RIZ√É, Mahid. From the Chili Bar: Hahsan, Kathu. Cleaning the room twice a day: Thalfah. And of course, the entire boat team: IFADEY, HASSAN, ZAIF, Haisha, and of course, Tropic Surf making each trip to surf a unique experience !!! You made our trip unforgettable, we are ready for the next one !!!"
"Our stay at Six Senses Laamu was absolutely incredible. Starting at our arrival to the Male airport, a gentleman from Six Senses was there to welcome us. They kindly seated us in a lounge where we waited for our plane ride to Kahdhoo Island airport followed by a speed boat ride to the Six Senses Resort located on Ohuveli Island in the Laamu Atoll.   When we arrived to the island, the GM and the GEMs (guest experience managers) were there to greet us. Our GEM was Aslah, he was very nice and attentive. He kept us well-informed of all the activities happening on the island and made us reservations for anything we wanted to do. All the other staff we met at the resort were amazing as well! Everybody was extremely kind, friendly and fun to chat with. Every single person went above‚Ä¶"
"Beyond our wildest imagination, Six Senses Laamu offered us a peek into what is possible. Our, stay, nearly two months long, was made of consecutive moments of awe and wonder. Starting with the obvious beauty of the Maldives, we were astounded by the purity of the pristine turquoise blue ocean and the intensity of color from the massive sunrises and sunsets. Dolphins leapt and spun, and we could see turtles swimming in the clear, clean water. We were thrilled to find that the perfect white sand beaches came without a single plastic bottle. We soon learned that they produce their own water there, and bottle it in reusable glass bottles. This fact alone gave us so much hope. In fact, the complete Six Senses commitment to environmental awareness and sustainability, and this resorts‚Ä¶"

"We stayed at Six Senses Laamu for our honeymoon for 7 nights and it was truly an incredible experience.  We stayed in an ocean villa in jetty A which is closest to everything but doesn‚Äôt have the most privacy as a jetty c would be but we liked how convenient the location was. If you want more privacy you may want a villa at the end.   The service is what really stood out at this resort. Our Gem Abdulla was awesome and would check in with us everyday on activities, dinners and make sure we were content. He did a great job and was nice to be able to ask questions via what‚Äôs app. The staff‚Äôs attention to detail is incredible and they would always know what we did that day and would ask us about it.   The food is also great but they don‚Äôt have a lot of options. Dinners are always a‚Ä¶"
"Staying at Six Senses Laamu is an incredible and unique experience. Our ‚ÄúGem‚Äù was Aslah and he was super helpful throughout the stay. All the services are amazing, and there are several activities that give you the opportunity to experience all the things you ever wanted. We did classes of surf with Nicole at Tropicsurf and were amazing, and snorkelling with Ali which was incredible also. Moreover, if you are a yoga fan don‚Äôt miss a hatha yoga class with Emma, these ones are amazing. We totally recommend to spend a week or more in Six Senses Laamu, if you like relaxing with quality, and to do water sports with an incredible service and super friendly staff."
"Six senses Laamu was definitely the best place to go to enjoy one of the most memorable and amazing honey moon trip. All the staff members are very friendly and helpful and make you feel like you are part of a big family. Our GEM, Aslah, was incredible and super helpful at all times. Also, one of the best experiencies was to make snorkeling with such an amazing team of marine biologists. Last but not least, six senses Laamu is heaven to do surf, wether you are a beginner or at an advanced level you will meet the most incredible teachers, specially Nicole, Justin and Uhmar and will be able to surf with the nicest views without being crowded. If you are planning to have vacations in complete connection with nature and feeling part of a big family six senses Laamu is definitely the‚Ä¶"

From our greeting upon arrival where we met GM Marteyne, Chef Stefan, and our GEM Abdulla to our departure just a week later, our entire experience was phenomenal. Each day, my husband and I really felt that every staff member wanted to be sure that our experience at SixSenses was personalized toward our particular tastes. The entire time you are there you feel a part of nature.

We like to thank especially our GEM Aslah, Sharhu, Risvi, Riza, Mino, Hamza, Adam, Viray, Stefan, Marlon, Alvina to mention just a small portion of this great team at the resort. We are happy once again and we already dream of our fourth trip to six senses laamu. We wish everybody health and see you soon!  Greetings Nico & Masha"
"Completely connected to nature and to the island, Sis Senses is the ideal place to spend magical days resting, diving, surfing, having amazing meals ans treatments at the spa. The hotel concerns with the environment are so important and all other hotels should follow their example. Amazing staff, nice, friendly and kind. A true paradise!"
we recently stayed at Six Senses. Best experience and service we've ever had.  Amazing staff always with a smile on their face and ready to make our stay as magical as possible. Must go: pic nic on the island. Best french toast. One of the best japanese omakase we've had. Amazing diving and surfing experience! Will definetly come back soon!
"Our stay at six senses was perfect! It was my first time in the maldives, and six senses is now definitly my favorite place. Like wooow! We were suposed to stay for 9 days, but since everything was so fun and amazing we just extended and extended everytime we were supposed to leave. We ended up leaving after a month, because we had to go home to school, if not we would probably stay for another month.  It is like in a movie, everything is perfect, and the people that works there are the best! All the activities was amazing! It was also my first time surfing, the waves are super good and it was super fun and thank you Umar for being the best surfcoach! The diving was fantastic, we saw a lot of fishes, turtles (some of them were pretty big), stingrays and black tip reef sharks. It‚Ä¶"
"Our stay at six senses was incredible! I won't even bother posting pictures as there are so many reviews and they still do not do the resort any justice. From the moment our plane landed the staff knew our name and every detail was handled. The amount of work that goes into this resort behind the scenes to make such great experience is incredible. It maybe weird to call a high end hotel an incredible value, but at the end it felt like we had a deal! If you are looking at the reviews, just book it!"
"Just finished 8 amazing nights on our honeymoon at Six Senses Laamu. Our Laamu Water Villa was great, with views of the island, the lagoon, and the ocean. Due to COVID there were not many other guests but they still had lots of activities available. The service and food were also top notch, as was the snorkeling in the reef just off the dock. Two tips: get a package with dinner included (or else be ready for some serious sticker shock), and bring some bug spray. Overall a 5 star experience and we will surely be back. Thank you Aslah, Alvina, Mario, CJ, Ali and everyone else who made our honeymoon so special!"
"Everything is a ten here, the place, the food, the service and specially the beautifulans familiar atmosphere you get from the firs instant, I will recommend to everybody that wants to discover an amazing place with water in all colours and enjoy of being in paradise. The staff is superb."
"Six Senses Laamu is amazing! The extra plane and boat to get there only adds to its charm and mistery. Even when you are arriving in the boat and dock you already feel who special and pampered you will be. The crew from Six Senses are 5 stars. Extremely competent and professional but with a big smile and always available to accommodate your every wish.  The accommodation are world class.  The food is delicious, specially at Leaf Restaurant. There you feel like you are in a Michelan de starred restaurant. Yes, it is that good!  I highly recommend going to Six Senses Laamu. It is really unforgettable!"
"From the initial contact to our final farewell, every aspect of the trip was exceptional. The staff is welcoming in the way you would welcome a friend into your home - authentic and personal.   The staff was well briefed on our dietary requirements and every meal was a culinary journey - I cannot say enough about the delicious and nutritious food - Chef Stefan is a genius in the way he pairs flavors. And the free ice cream - what a great way to recharge between dives.   And the diving! The dive center is well staffed and professional with safety clearly the #1 priority. And, the team are open to dive site requests so we could plan our dives to our certification level.   The rooms are beautiful with every need considered and catered.   We celebrated two special occasions which‚Ä¶"
"Everything from start to finish (and sadly it had to) was incredible.  The island, accommodation, food, activities and people were ALL nothing short of wonderful.  A truly memorable and special holiday.  Thank you everyone at Six Senses, we‚Äôll definitely be back! ü•∞"
"Had an amazing two weeks, the weather and beaches were amazing. The staff were very kind and friendly. The food was excellent and varied from day to day and the experiences offered were great and varied especially the diving."
"I had an amazing two week stay at Six Senses Laamu, the staff were so attentive and always willing to help out, with a special thank you to our GEM Aslah! The food was all delicious, the beaches lovely and huge array of things to do on the water. I will be back!"
"Hands down best all around experience. I went for the surf but got way more. The food is amazing, chef Stephan and Lead restaurant provided Michelin starred dinners. The staff is second to none, and the beauty of the place wraps it all up. Wish I could give 6 stars."
"Everything we expected from a Six Senses. The flight & boat transfer are a chore as is the lack of fish when snorkelling/diving (I've visited the Maldives many times). Service, food, drinks all exceptional. Worth a visit"
We have just spent two blissful weeks at Six Senses Laamu.  We are frequent Maldives travellers and it was our third visit to Laamu - and we could not have picked a better place to completely escape to in August 2020.  Here‚Äôs why‚Ä¶.  1.	A safe haven from COVID.  We flew on Emirates (as do 95% of the guests) and we took enormous comfort that all our travel companions had been PCR tested ‚Äì it felt a lot safer than the UK generally.  The Emirates plane and Dubai airport literally sparkled. The resort checked our temperatures daily and arranged for our return PCR test a few days before we left.  Masks are only worn inside (the very few) enclosed areas and the combination of the testing regime and the wide-open spaces allowed us to completely leave COVID behind us for a couple of‚Ä¶
"This is not a review that we write lightly.   We have been fortunate to enjoy many extraordinary holidays in the Maldives and unfortunately this just isn't anywhere near the same level.   The island is lovely, well laid out with different areas, and we liked the layout of the public spaces.  Our over water villa was beautiful. The only downside was that it's not private. Anyone walking down the jetty can see into your bedroom unless you keep the blinds on the floor to ceiling windows closed. Your deck isn't private either and you can be easily seen from other villas. Being used to the privacy that's generally an integral part of the Maldives we found this odd.  Housekeeping wasn't good. We were left without towels a number of times and without shower gel for 24 hours. Calling‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses Laamu had me at Meruhabaa, from the moment Abdulla picked us up on a private speedboat, to our immaculate luxury experience. All the details‚Äîattentive service, exceptional dining, exquisite overwater villa‚Äîmade my tranquil stay truly unforgettable. Here I enjoyed endless activities in water and on land, including open water diving course, surfing lessons, dolphin sunset cruise, Asana with Emma and indulgent spa treatments.  Every moment is a movie scene‚Äîbalmy sea waves, fiery shooting stars; every being‚Äîwhitetip reef sharks, green sea turtles, bats, crabs, geckos, they all radiate benevolence, basking in the atoll‚Äôs beautiful energy.  Special thanks to our sweetest Guest Experience Maker üíé Abdulla, yoga instructor turned long lost friend Emma, PADI instructor‚Ä¶"
"Beautiful resort, with fantastic food, facilities, activities and service from great people. Special mentions for our GEM Aslah and diving instructor Danny. Would definitely return, and not just for the free daily ice cream!"
"We had an amazing time in six senses, everybody was so nice and kind. Our guest experience maker, Aslah, was extremely discrete and dedicated to us.  The resort is magnificent.  We truly recommend this place if you are a nature lover.  You will indeed see a lot of friendly sharks, turtles, dolfins, and so many other species of fish right in front of your villa."
"Our girls trip to Six Senses Laamu was hands down the best of 2020! Incredible once-in-a-lifetime stay.   The staff spared no effort to make us feel welcome and cherished. We felt we were visiting a family, one that anticipated our every need and dream. Marteyne the GM was incredible as head of the family, and Abdulla our GEM really defined the term ‚ÄúGEM‚Äù (general experience manager- one of a kind). We had a birthday celebration on the beach that I will never forget!  The food was absolutely incredible. I maintain a strict no dairy, no gluten and no egg diet and not once did I feel out of place. The head Chef Stefan is a pure genius, and all the staff know the dishes so well it‚Äôs incredible. The taste was phenomenal every day, and having organic locally grown herbs was such a‚Ä¶"
"this was my first time at a luxury resort and lemme say... six senses laamu sets the bar HIGH! everyone in the staff is so nice it honestly freaked me out how much they cared. the second we stepped off the boat we were met with such a warm welcome. our gem aslah treated my aunt and I like queens! the views are to die for, I can die peacefully now after seeing these sunsets and beaches. don‚Äôt even get me started on the food I gained like 20 kilos I couldn‚Äôt stop myself üö´nayüö´I didn‚Äôt want to stop myself. the only thing I regret from my stay here is that I didn‚Äôt stay longer. VIVA LA SIX SENSES LAAMU!!!!"
"Had a fabulous time at Six Sense, especially thanks to my GEM Aslah and the fabulous crew who helped us surf, dive, tube, photograph, swim and relax fabulously! The food is particularly awesome and the local Sri Lankan fare is outstanding. Wonderful five star resort that I will miss sorely once I return to dreary London! Thanks to everyone for the lovely trip!!"
"We stay at Six Senses Laamu for one week in August 2020 and we can say that it was amazing for our ‚Äúsix‚Äù senses!!.  When selecting Maldives for holidays you expect to stay in a beautiful resort surrounded by pristine water full of life, but Six Senses Laamu was much more that what we expected.   Apart from the resort itself and the beauty it is surrounded, the staff is the key point that supported our incredible stay. All of them made their best to ensure that our stay was excellent... and it was more than that!! We really felt like at home. Among them, our GEM Abdulla deserves special words. He was so sweet, so caring, so amazing!! And he took care of us just to the point, not too close but always available when we need it.  An additional and unexpected point that made our stay‚Ä¶"
"Amazing resort. Environmentally concerned, ready and safe for covid, superb surf service and waves; nice hosts from the cleaning team to the general manager, not forgetting the F&B guys, the reception guys and our GEM. Food is of unbelievable quality, taste and finesse. Really an amazing experience we would not hesitate to recommend to anyone interested in an excellent resort ready to cater all your needs. And laidback like it should be. Wonderful."
"After trying one Six Senses in Samui, we wanted to visit Six Senses Laamu.   We booked last minute in covid-time for 2 weeks. Despite Covid, we had an amazing stay and the team did everything they could to offer the best possible service in this difficult time (particularly as far as supply was concerned).   THE HOTEL : it's beautiful. Fully made of wood and really fits the nature it's set-up in.   THE ROOM : We had a Laamu Water Villa (thank you a lot for the upgrade !!) on jetty C. It was really beautiful. Not the most spacious one, but maybe the most amazing bathroom we've seen in the many hotels we've visited. One recommendation : if you have children or are not comfortable with swimming, avoid jetty C and go on jetty A. Jetty C is more exposed to waves (which was OK for us,‚Ä¶"
Me and my mom visited Six Senses at Laamu. I was welcomed with smiles and accommodated with amazing staff. The communication and awareness of Laamu made my stay very easy and peaceful. The spa felt unreal with it‚Äôs beautiful structure and treatments. The food was multicultural and the view was breathtaking!  Our Guest Experience Manager Abdullah was so nice and made my stay perfect! Everybody was so social and friendly.  Truly amazing branch of the Six Senses Brand!   
"Our week at the Six Senses Laamu was better than we could ever have imagined. We were part of the first group of guests arriving after the four month closure due to Covid-19, and they had gone to every extent to ensure the safety of guests. We had our temperature checked every morning and they got the resort doctor to take our PCR test in our hotel room so our holiday wasn't disrupted. Couldn't have been a smoother process. The regulation in the Maldives pertains masks only need to be worn in enclosed spaces, and as the resort is 99% open spaces¬†it was almost like the Coronavirus was a distant memory.  We had a sunset villa on Jetty A, which was stunning. Our room was always clean but we never heard a whisper of room service,¬†who seemed to always know when we were out.‚Ä¶"
"The experience at Six Senses Laamu has been incredible. Hands down, best honeymoon one can ask for. Staff has been very attentive and helpful at all times. From our room in Jetty C, we have been able to see all kinds of coral fish, rays and turtles. Daily snorkelling tour around the house reef is led by one of the marine biologists on-site, who will also explain their initiatives for protecting the atoll. High level cuisine with many different options. Spa and dolphin tour highly recommended.  Once again, thanks to all the staff for the best experience ever! Special mention to staff at SipSip and Chilly, to MUI team led by Ali and of course to our GEM, Aslah. Hope we will be able to come back again soon!!"
"I would rate Laamu 100/100 - as it is the ultimate barefoot vacation experience. From the very beginning, until the very end, every single detail is mastered at this resort. Thanks to the GEM and the entire staff, I had one of the best experiences of my life here. Especially, the sunset and the night sky here is amazing. Food is one of the best in the world - Fresh, organic, and delicious + They grow their own vegetables Especially, their breakfast blew my mind every time. The rooms are top-notch and very well designed. Aerial yoga and fitness instructors know their craft. Definitely try the morning aerial yoga or the sunset yoga on the beach. Laamu is a very conscious and sustainable resort indeed. Also, they support the Maldivian locals. Every penny will be worth for this‚Ä¶"
"We had a funny trip at SS. We met perfect chefs, Marlon and Xuan Anh at Japanese restaurent. They cooked foods very well. Also thanks to Mrs Linh spa therapist because she brought the bicycle tag back to Vietnam for us. Thanks to Emma, our Experience Maker, Emma was nice and she try all her effort to fulfill our honeymoon. I also deliver my appreciation to Arif, who taught me a short lesson about atolls. The football match I played with them was unforgetable and I am really apreciated to be joined. Absolutely Six Senses will be our destination in next time in Maldives. Nhi & Nghi"
"Thks to the general manager an exceptionnal woman on an exceptionnal ""sixsenses""... you will never find better place in Maldivian Island to be. Quality of service is on the up of all sixsense we know... Don's search more...We will come back... and we know a lot of other exceptionnal places on the small planet.."
"This place is truly Special  for us. We spent our honeymoon days at this heaven on Earth! Every little things in this island is simply amazing - views, water, food, people and spectacular service. Thanks to our GEM who never leaves us until our last day and the entire team for the efforts in throwing us the best service they can give! See you on December , hopefully!"
"Very relaxing, so clean and breathtaking throughout! Highly recommend for honey moon. The food was amazing and 100% organic. You could always do something with the activities. I loved it so much and would go again "
"We had an amazing stay and holiday at this resort. Everything is simply perfect and indescribable.  All staff members on the island are all professional and always ready to give a hand, a warm thanks to all of you! Well done, all! We'll  be back  very soon!"
"From service to location this hotel is one of the most memorable hotel experiences I've ever had. From the service to the excursions that the hotel offers, I've truly had the most experience ever. If you get a chance you really must come because this hotel really is once in a lifetime!"
"It was a dream beyond dreams! The flight from Alberta was grueling flight delayed in Male, but to wake up in the morning to where we were was amazing!  Most hotel rooms I spend little time.. I didn't want to leave our over water Villa, all wood and wicker and relaxing...and you don't have to.. Every detail was seen to by our G.E.M and the staff, all went beyond beyond beyond my expectations ... Never felt shaken down for a tip, it was just willing, greatful service, I almost couldn't get used to it, I wanted a mojito, the head bartender told all the others bartenders how I liked mine.... Almost odd but Amazing!! Swam with sharks, mantas, turtles , seen dolphins.... And the food was beyond fresh and innovative... This place is romantic on a different level because of how relaxed‚Ä¶"
"This was the second visit to the beautiful Six Senses Laamu and we absolutely loved our stay. Before we arrived at Laamu, our speedboat hosts encouraged us to take off our shoes and to only walk barefoot on the island during our entire stay - magical! This certainly kick-started the holiday! It was fabulous to have the same GEM welcoming us on arrival and who took good care of us during our stay. Heads up to her and the Head of Travel in assisting us with our return International flights - something that was totally unexpected and hugely appreciated. The complimentary snorkeling with the marine biologists at 11am daily was great and loved the turtle dive too. Food all round was very good at the different restaurants. Try a pizza at lunch time while enjoying drinks at the Sip Sip‚Ä¶"
"This is our first vacation in Maldives and our first in a six senses resort. The most amazing place we‚Äôve been to. Our overwater villa is perfect with stunning wide ocean view. Crystal clear waters, our feet enjoyed the soft light sand. Food is second to none- our favorites Zen and Leaf, make sure you dine here!!! The entire 6 days was heaven! Definitely recommend it!"
"I had an increadible experience at Six Senses Laamu. They have the best Staff, good options of restaurants, amazing SPA and Gym, and beautiful room! They also have watersports, special activities, scuba diving and a cinema under the stars."
"We chose this place to celebrate my 40th birthday and 16th wedding anniversary. It could not be better. I traveled with my husband and kids (ages 9 and 7). We have been spoiled all the times. Thor, our guest experience maker, made sure that all of our expectations were met. We have stayed in a beach villa with pool. The room is stunning with a breathtaking view of the ocean with great sea life. We had private bicycles to ride through the island, which is cozy and great size, not that big. Kids also enjoyed at the kids club, where they were kindly welcomed by Lala. Everyday we had homemade and free ice cream, always welcomed by a great smile of the lady in charge of serving guests. Definitely, this was our best family trip ever. If you think Maldives is not a place for kids, my‚Ä¶"
"This was our thrid visit to the Maldives so our expectations were already very high...but...wow...this place is truly exceptional in every single way.  The service from all of the staff is at the highest level without being stuffy or in your face. Your personal GEM is your main point of contact and can organise anything for you with a single phone call.  The food is usually a highlight of any Maldives trip and this was no exception. There are plenty of options on the standard menu although we are vegan so the choices are quite limited. However, you can ask for anything and the chefs will happily make it for you so they are very accommodating. There's a free ice cream bar where you can get a home made sorbet or ice cream as often as you like. Loads of flavours to choose from and‚Ä¶"
"My husband and I honeymooned here February 2020, and absolutely loved everything about the resort! Our over water villa was beautiful,  comfortable, and private. The snorkeling and scuba diving was wonderful, the staff was attentive, and the food was delicious. There were plenty of activities to keep you entertained, although relaxing at the villa was equally as nice. Our GEM (guest experience manager), Afra, checked in with us daily to make sure all was going well, and helped make and change reservations as needed. Speaking of reservations, don't miss having dinner at Leaf. Yum!   We stayed in villa 5, a sunset view villa on Jetty A. We had originally requested a villa further down the jetty, thinking we'd have more privacy further down the jetty, and less noise from the‚Ä¶"
"From being met at Male airport to arriving back at the airport after our stay we were looked after perfectly, we couldn‚Äôt have asked for better.   Easy transfer at Male, supported by six senses staff who were waiting for us on arrival. Had free use of a nice lounge whilst waiting a short time for our domestic flight, bags all taken care of. Shortly flight and met by more Six Senses staff for the speed boat to Laamu, bags all taken care of again. Drink, snack and lovely cool towel on the boat, which is getting completely disinfected between each trip at the moment. Love the touch of giving you a shoe bag to put your shoes into on the boat so you can arrive bare foot if you want.   Welcomed by the staff and short tour by our assigned GEM. The island really is a paradise.   Villa‚Ä¶"
"Stayed in a sunset Laamu overwater villa with pool which exceeded expectations!  Very kind staff- our GEM Thohir was phenomenal!  Despite everything going on in the world with coronavirus, they made the perfect experience for our anniversary.  Would highly recommend!"
"Having been to the Maldives on twelve previous occasions & given the general hype surrounding this 'eco friendly' island, we were ready for potential disappointment. Not a bit of it ..!!    Apart from their passion for all things 'eco friendly' and their stoic dedication to protecting their lovely atol and every living thing in the sea around them, there are two main differences that distinguish this island from many others we have visited:  their general standards of service and their take on the Butler - the GEM.  1) The staff certainly boasted a very high collective standard in terms of the service they delivered. Yes they were all the things one might expect from staff on a Maldivian island in terms of being friendly, willing & helpful, but unlike some other islands we've‚Ä¶"
"I am a fan of Six Senses. This one was great, as always. Luxury accommodation over the water, great food, great service, but with a casual relaxed touch. I loved it, weather was perfect. A special plus : the picnic on a deserted island. That was the best experience i ever had in a resort. Try it"
"We felt very luck to be at this hotel, it was the best hotel treatment we've ever had, everything perfect, cleanliness, stay, wonderful food, all the staff very helpful and polite!  I hope we have the opportunity to return!  Thank you for making my family time so special ‚ù§Ô∏è"
I want to thank the management of Six Sense for their honesty and accommodating our cancellation during the time of the Corona-virus Covid-19. My wife and I planned a 7 night stay and wedding on the Sandbank a year and half in the making before the virus broke out. The virus Gradually grew worse and Management notified us about the situation at the resort and agreed to grant us a full refund no questions asked. I want to thank Mr Graeme Freeman for thinking of us and putting our health and lives first before profits. A true gentleman and we look forward to visiting in the future. God Bless
"We stayed for a thoroughly magical, unforgettable, perfect 2 weeks at the beginning of March 2020 - just before the craziness that ensued globally - staying in ""Sunset Laamu Water Villa"" number 13 on Jetty A.  Rather than give a separate review, below is an email I sent to the IHG area manager as they begin to integrate Six Senses into the Intercontinental chain:  ""We have been to many amazing places in the world, but we both truly agree that this is one destination where even glossy brochures and multimedia websites cannot convey how stunning and paradise-like Six Senses Laamu truly is.  The overall ethos of Six Senses, which we learned more about on our ‚Äúback-of-house‚Äù tour with Vadi, is outstanding and something that we truly hope the integration into IHG does not alter,‚Ä¶"
"We stayed for a week in an overwater villa (65) on halfboard. We were completely blessed with the weather, barely a cloud the whole trip. It's a long trip to get there with the internal flight, but was worth it once you step off the speedboat without your shoes. The rooms are spacious and well thought out with wonderful views from every angle (loved the outdoor shower and access to the lagoon from the shower). The bikes were a highlight and pleasurable way to get around the island. The house reef from chill bar was fabulous to see turtles and fish. Our GEM, Edith, was wonderful and the right balance of help along with not interfering. She made my birthday extra special with dinner at Leaf and a photo from our holiday printed on the table. A special shout out to Jailan who served‚Ä¶"
"I will never forget our arrival to the resort on the six senses boat, it‚Äôs got the wow factor for sure.  Upon arrival we were met by the Manager of the resort and introduced to our GEM, Aslah. Aslah couldn‚Äôt do enough for us during our stay checking each day to make sure we had everything we needed, addressing any concerns (there wasn‚Äôt any) and making our reservations for dining and experiences.  We arrived for a 10 night stay, 5 nights in a Beach Villa and 5 nights in an Overwater Villa. Both exceeded our expectations and are beautiful in their own unique ways. The restaurants are all wonderful. Leaf is fine dining and Zen (Japanese) we‚Äôre our most frequented. The chefs at Zen were very accommodating to changing the menu to suit our tastes.  The Chill Bar is amazing for both‚Ä¶"
We have traveled extensively and were on a 75 day trip throughout Asia ending with the Maldives.  We thought we were saving the best for last!  Not so. We spent a few days at the FANTASTIC FOUR SEASONS at Kuda Huraa and were looking forward to the Six Senses for 12 days. Four Seasons picked us up from Male in a beautiful air conditioned Yacht and shared with us history and information about the areas we passed as we headed to the hotel.  We were under the impression that the almost $700.00 a person round trip air fare to the Six Senses was going to be a private or nice plane.  It was a twin engined prop plane with lots of locals paying a lot less for the same trip we are on.  Tourist pay A LOT more than locals.  When we landed we could not find anyone with a sign or shirt saying‚Ä¶
"After 9 days on the Island, we sadly had to leave but with a lot of memories in our heads. All was amazing: the beach, the color of the sea, the houses (very well equiped), the diversity of the food (and the quality). If you want to relax, you have to go on Six Seens for sure."
"  We have recently returned from staying at the resort for 8 nights. Yes it is a long way compared to some of the other islands but it‚Äôs well worth the journey.  The shoes off relaxed feel was just what we wanted. Riding bikes to dinner and being able to relax over great food is fantastic   We stayed in a Laamu water villa with a pool and as well as the great view (and glass bath) the highlight was being able to have breakfast in our room until midday for no extra cost in this room type.  Our GEM Najar was amazing but not too intrusive. The staff throughout the island are a credit to the resort. Particular standouts for us were the barmen Jerry; Balla and Mario who smiled constantly, and made the most amazing cocktails.  Our favourite restaurant was the chill bar and we were‚Ä¶"
"It‚Äôs a long way to come but worth it. We had villa over water with pool. Perfect in every way. Great food at a good mix of cuisine, Indian, Japanese, International. Mind you, once you‚Äôve had the incredible breakfast your hardly need to eat rest of day. Staff great and v friendly. Negatives. Wine list unbelievably expensive! Dive shop moody."
"This was a return visit for us and quite frankly, although I wouldn't have thought it possible, it was even better than before!! Spectacular setting, fabulous food, amazing rooms and simply stunning service - what more can I say!!"
"Amazing traveling experience, not only the friendly staff,  but also the delicate food and thoughtful arrangements. Also impressed by the concern of sustainability from the resort (Heart of House Tour- highly recommended !)  Meanwhile, the natural environment at Laamu atoll is extraordinary, during our stay, we met turtles, rays, uncountable fishes and even sharks!  Special thanks to our GEM, Emma, and also many sweet staff gave us this unforgettable trip :)"
"We have just enjoyed our second visit. One of our must haves is good vegan food, and again we were not disappointed. In particular Manoj at Longitude and Ismath (pastry chef who created amazing deserts - see our pictures). We stayed at overwater villa 24 and 21 which get sun on the deck all day. We loved the snorkelling in the Lagoon (turtles, Rays and all sorts of fish including a Lion fish). Also we would swim round to the reef to see the amazing fish and coral. The coral has had a lot of bleaching but is recovering. We also appreciate all the Eco work that the resort promotes and sponsors - I didn‚Äôt realise that sea grass and mangroves are a better carbon sink than rainforest trees! Many thanks to all the staff, including Arif ( our GEM), Hemant (gym) and so many others."
"We had a wonderful week ax Six Senses Laamu. It was our third time, and we hope to return one day. The see and beach are breathtaking beautiful. While snorkling we saw turtles, dolphins and a (harmless) shark.  The hotel organises  a lot of excursions, the ones with marine biologists Laurence and Pip were our favourites. But just staying at the amazing pool is also great fun and very relaxing. Thanks to all the staffmembers  for making our stay so great, and a special thanks to GEM Ashlah: you're the best!"
"My room was a bungalow over the sea, with a pool, quiet ; sometimes we had brakfast there, while turtles and fishes wonder around, just below us. The staff were the nicest i¬¥ve seen. I find myself writing this review lacking the words which would reflect exactly my feelings about this incredible paradise."
"We wanted to send our thanks to the Six Senses staff especially our Guest Experience Manager (GEM) Najah, who was absolutely the best and made us feel so welcome and relaxed our whole trip (including looking for my lost hat, when it turned out I had it in my bag lol, and also secretly putting our initials on our bikes when we weren't looking).  We went to Six Senses Laamu for our belated honeymoon, and it was our first trip to the Maldives (chosen over Bora Bora). We had wondered if the Maldives was really worth it, however our expectations (which were high) were just blown away!    From the minute we stepped off the plane from Mal√© we felt we were in another world. Our favorites, although there are too many to list: 1) Swimming/ diving off our Ocean water villa every morning‚Ä¶"
"It takes a long time to get here but it is a unique property. So much thought and love has gone into making this a blissful place to be. Nothing is too much trouble. It‚Äôs 5 star all the way. The trip ‚Äúbackstage‚Äù to the host village is an eye opener to the effort and commitment gone into creating this experience. We spent 5 days here, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend less but you could do more. It‚Äôs expensive, most activities are extra so it is undeniably a very special treat. Unforgettable."
We discovered the most wonderful island with magical staff and extraordinary food. A very good choice with a kid as there is a kid club! Everything is perfect ! You don't want to leave. Now I only want to come back
"Amazing resort and staff - really go the extra mile to make sure your stay is perfect . Beautiful place , true heaven on earth. Thank you for an amazing stay and honeymoon, and the ice cream was amazing !"
"Awesome stay at Six Senses Laamu. We were celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary and really loved the experience. Their breakfast is probably the best in the world and we have seen many. Water villas are very unique and you can easily forget the time and date and just enjoy. Our gem, Ali, was great and helped us to get most of our relaxing vacation. Highly recommended!"
"Our Ocean Villa was pure magic. Imagine that you step out of bed and slide into the warm lagoon crystal clear water and swim with the colorful fish. One evening sitting on the terrace in silence watching the full moon shining on you and enjoying cold white wine. How romantic can it be? Many thanks to the polite and considerate personnel taking care of all details, and our outstanding GEM Mr. Abdulla, who made this an unforgettable vacation."
"Quite simply the best family holiday we have ever had. Our boys are 6 and 9, and loved the freedom they could have because the hotel is its own island. So good we are going back again this year. You could not stay in a better place, or be in better hands than Marteyne and her team."
"Best resort for sure, wonderful staff, all very attentive and careful. the room always clean, spend 3 times a day to organize .very good food. most beautiful place in the world, has the sand bank which is wonderful. Certainly the best resort, in the most beautiful and magical place. A Paradise!!! Thank you Ahsla, for taking care of every detail, Raalhey, and chef."
"Waking up to the sound of the sea all around our over water villa and slipping into the warm, crystal-clear water off our terrace was a blissful start to every day in Six Senses Laamu.  We had a wonderful week there and I would go back again like a shot.  Everything in the resort is beautifully managed and it is probably one of the most relaxing places I have ever been to. The accommodation was excellent with every need anticipated and catered for. The food was delicious with breakfast being another thing to really look forward to. There are plenty of activities with a gym and spa, snorkeling, diving, surfing, kayaking and day trips to other islands.  A lovely touch is the ice cream which is home-made, delicious and free - we didn't manage to achieve our goal of sampling all 21‚Ä¶"
"Wonderful hotel on a beautiful island. The service was amazing, food varied and excellent, plenty of things to do and we had a brilliant time. Daniel our Guest Experience Manager was exceptional and took great care of us."
"This place is real Paradise !!!   Beautiful villas, amazing views, delicious food !!! Tastes that I have never had a chance to try before. Everything from bio products. Wonderful and pleasant service. Special thanks to Auzam - thanks to you our trip was even more special. I recommend to everyone !!! Certainly next year we will come again it was our greatest vacation. Oh !!! I forgot write about the ICE CREAMS !!! They have 42 flavours !!! The best ice creams in my life !! They are for free for all the guest - beautiful idea. Love You Six Senses for all the experience !!! See You next Year !! :-)"
"An amazing team delivering wonderful calm and gentle service of great rooms, food and drink, all against a backdrop of beautiful seas, coral, turtles and rays - what more could you wish for.  A special mention for Mila and Queeny two great hosts, and Megan for helping us to see just how much of a difference we can make to this beautiful environment."
"We had an incredible time at our recent stay at Six Senses Laamu.    Immediately upon landing in Male - you are greeted by the staff and fully taken care of until your return flight.   The resort itself is amazing -  for me it has everything you would want for a beach vacation,  privacy, beautiful scenery, water sports activities, fantastic villas, and delicious food.   I also value their eco friendly vision - take the ""back of the house"" tour if you are interested.   If you enjoy learning about the local marine life, they have marine biologists who are available during boat outings and during snorkeling.  Pip was the marine biologist I met - she was extremely friendly and knowledgeable.   As far as service is concerned, this is some of the best service I have ever had while‚Ä¶"
"We had the lagoon beach view room. It was big enough for three people with everything you needed. Great staff, kind and always ready to support your requests. Beautiful beaches, excellent and healthy food. Many water sports to choose from. A perfect place, also thanks to our GEM Mr. Ravah."
"Incredible and diverse opportunities for free-diving right off the beaches. Sea grass, reefs, and pinnacles.  Scuba dived twice, both times on the same site, which was a bit repetitive. Manta rays are apparently quite scarce, we didn't get a chance to see them.  Awesome breakfast included, all sorts of dining options available. Meals are otherwise very expensive, but delicious. However, breakfast is often big enough to tide one over until supper.  All the staff are very friendly, and you are constantly greeted with a smile. Any request to make your life even a tiny bit easier is dealt with immediately. The staff operate efficiently, and manage to be very unobtrusive.  Included amenities and facilities are very comprehensive. The room was amazing, and many tiny details make it‚Ä¶"
"This is an incredible hotel, with incredibly helpful and polite staff.  The resort is impeccably kept and there are plenty of amazing activities (which of course come at a very high cost - but that‚Äôs the Maldives).  The food is excellent as well. Everything about this hotel is top notch and we will be returning.   We have rates this 5 stars as we really did have such an amazing time. However, a few bits of feedback which are more aimed to the management of six senses (rather than the incredible staff) - charging over 6 dollars for drinking water is extortionate.  Everyone staying here is paying a lot of money to be there already and this is a step too far, drinking water should be free.  This isn‚Äôt branded Fiji or Evian water which costs a lot of money to import, it‚Äôs distilled‚Ä¶"
"We have just returned from a fantastic 10-days at the Sic Senses Laamu. Being our first trip to the Maldives, we did an awful lot of research on where to go and also received several recommendations on this resort. We were not disappointed - the place is absolutely fantastic - stunning!!! We stayed in an over-water Ocean Villa (no 65) towards the end of Jetty C. Stunning - absolutely perfect. Would recommend this location as it's away from the main restaurants etc but very easy to get anywhere. Everyone get's bikes and its great to have a leisurely ride around. The beaches and island in general is pristine and the water is crystal clear. Lots of fish can be seen as well as turtles and rays. You may even see the off shark while snorkelling but they are very friendly! The staff‚Ä¶"
"We stayed one week in Six Senses in January 2020 and every day was like waking up in paradise. The whole resort is a dream: lovely staff, nice villas, marvelous nature, excellent service, phantastic food. Our GEM Najah welcomed us so nicely and gave us a wonderful introduction into the hotel. Najah was always on our side when we had questions or problems to solve. He organised wonderful bookings for our stay, so that we could only enjoy and relax. From the beginng we felt home, as everybody from the staff was so friendly and warm - anticipating every wish we had.  We had a very good support through our diving instructors Nick and Danny, as they took very good care of us on our dives. Nick showed us wonderful places with mantas (many thanks to Nicole for the interesting‚Ä¶"
"I had the pleasure to visit Six Senses Laamu in January 2020. This was my 2nd visit to the resort within an 11-month period. I can only give Six Senses Laamu my highest appraisal - this is just heaven on earth. Six Senses Laamu operates on a barefoot luxury approach which becomes me very well. Whilst the amnesties, food, service, staff, the island, etc. all is second to none, it doesn‚Äôt feel stiff, snobbish, pretentions or anything like it.  All staff member of Six Senses Laamu, from the guys sweeping the beach every day, to housekeeper, to restaurant staff, to GEM, etc., all are so very friendly. Everyone delivers a personal and professional service with the warmth and genuine smile that I just haven‚Äôt met anywhere else.  Six Senses Laamu have several options for dinner. My‚Ä¶"
"My wife and I decided to take our honeymoon trip at Six Senses Laamu, and it was the absolute perfect choice. We had literally zero complaints, and we were blown away by the incredible incredible service of every single member of the Six Senses staff. They go so, so far beyond what is expected to make sure every single part of your stay is perfect. Our GEM Aslah was out of this world. I can‚Äôt describe how many times he went out of his way to make our visit even more special. He really played a huge role in making this trip so perfect. We would recommend this place to anyone, anytime. The food was out of this world (and we‚Äôre used to some pretty good food in LA), the excursions were incredibly fun, and the service was sensational. There are just so many small things that they do‚Ä¶"
"This has been the best vacation ever! We are newlyweds from America, and we really wanted to travel outside the country for our honeymoon. After exploring online, we chose Six Senses Laamu and, boy oh boy, were we impressed! This was hands down the best service we have ever received, the food was incredible, and our GEM, Aslah, was TERRIFIC! Love it! We hope to be back soon!"
We had the pleasure of staying at Six Senses in December 2019 as part of our honeymoon. From the second you land you are greeted by the Six senses staff who immediately make you feel welcome and you s  Shifu was our GEM and was always there making sure everything was fine and that our stay
"The Maldives - one of the most beautiful and unique places in the world. If you also want to stay in a special resort there, Six Senses Laamu is the right place for you. Because it is contemporary and relaxed luxury. Because you don't need shoes, because the service is top notch and simply everything is beautiful, no matter where you look. The Six Senses concept is one of the most modern concepts the hotel market currently offers and has no problem competing with the older and bigger brands like Four Seasons etc. Those who have been here once know what the somewhat long journey is worthwhile for.   Pro _ Beautiful water bungalows with large outdoor pool and outdoor shower and a great terrace _ Almost all restaurants built over the water, with unique architecture and a very‚Ä¶"
"One of the greatest experience I ever had.  Hotel Island is wonderful, all places are inspiring, quiet and great to relax.  Family and kids are welcome and there is a lot of activities for all ages. Great variety of restaurants and food. All of them have perfect food, like Michelin restaurants. Staff is very polite, attentive and supportive. Suggest to book the room with all meals included (full board). A place to visit again in some years and with my kids."
It was our third stay at six senses Laamu and as usual everything was perfect. A special thanks to our GEM Nasru who was always at our disposal to make this stay as relaxing as possible. The Zen restaurant is at the top !
"Incredible resort. Much more low-key and simple, eco-friendly beauty than the other Maldives resort I have stayed in (Sheraton). helpful staff, laid back vibe, the ocean villa we stayed in was incredible and had so many different nooks to relax in. Tried surfing for the first time with a super friendly and patient teacher. Delicious food. There‚Äôs a sense of understated beauty here that doesn‚Äôt feel too commercial or flashy. I love the environmentally friendly ethos. Also FREE ICE CREAM 35 FLAVOURS - WHAT A BONUS!"
"Me & Wife visited six sense laamu with very high expectations after doing a lot of research to choose a best place in Maldives..Our experience in six sense laamu was beyond our expectation..Food was amazing..Villas was very clean & neat..All the staffs in the island were really helpful and kind..Free ice cream you gets every day which was a additional touch to compliment..To Mention few names who helped us to make our stay memorable (Ahdhu (housekeeper), Moosa (our room boy), Abidha from ice cream, Ziyaan (sip sip) and above all Aslah our GEM who made sure we had everything we needed..No request of us was too much for him..Highly recommend this resort to everyone..Thanks againüôÇ"
"We had a perfect time in Maldives at Six Sense Laamu! They know how to create an atmosphere where you can feel really in paradise. The overwater villas are enchanting, the spa is fantastic, and you‚Äôll have a variety of restaurants with very good cuisine options (don't miss Leaf). But for us the staff is the most impressive part of the resort - all employees treat you in an unique, enthusiastic and happy way. Also they will appoint a GEM (guest experience maker) to take care of you during your stay - everything you need any time you can call direct to your GEM, Aslah was our GEM and he made our stay really memorable..Cant wait to be back again..Thank you six sense laamu."

Most of all I would like to thank the Chef- we had a great cuisine experience, the quality, creativity, health balanced and the choice are the standard of the best world Michelin restaurants.

"Was here from 25-30 Dec with 2 girlfriends. I fell in love with the resort the moment I step into their jetty. I like the concept where guests are encouraged to go barefooted & casual. There is no need for any formalities throughout the resort. I liked the great service that is offered by ALL the staff during my stay, you can sense their passion & how they love their job. They are the key success factor to what makes my stay so memorable & wonderful. Loved the idea of dropping by the chill bar for free ice cream & sorbet (42 flavours in total) every afternoon & evening. I‚Äôm also very impressed by the resort‚Äôs sustainability efforts & I liked the sustainability walking tour.

"We absolutely loved our stay at Six Senses!! We went for our honeymoon and could not have picked a better spot. The villa on the water was spectacular--the view, the amenities and the constant top-class service. It was truly the perfect spot to spend a day lounging or jump immediately into the water to snorkel. We saw sea turtles, small sharks, tons of stunning fish and even a manta ray right outside our room!   The food was, also, great! We especially loved the breakfast buffet and Leaf Restaurant. There were a ton of great activities that ranged from free interesting activities (Back of House tour, environmental/sustainability talks, stargazing/sun-gazing with a brilliant astronomer and tour with their on-island chocolate alchemist). You could also pay for a lot of other‚Ä¶"
"Getting there is a real task. Given the local flight is just 3-5 times a day, you can end up waiting hours at male airport where there is nothing to do for hours. This for me was a big ordeal our incoming was 1 hr late so we missed the 2 pm local flight, the next one was 6 pm which was full, so we were told we would have to take a flight at midnight. After shouting fighting they managed to get us on the 6 pm. We were upset at the lack of information provided as the hotel did not inform us about what would happen in the case of a flight being delayed, they were also very murky with no fixed timings and the local flight their.

"As a solo traveller in the Maldives I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect from my stay but I was blown away from start to finish of this trip. I have travelled very extensively and I would easily say this is the best resort I‚Äôve come across.  At first I was met at the airport where my boat transfer provided a welcome drink, some coconut and onboard wifi.  On arrival I was greeted by name and shown the facilities by my GEM (guest experience manager). My GEM checked in daily to ask how I was going and if there was anything he could help with.  I stayed in the water villa with pool and just WOW. It exceeded my expectations in every way possible. I snorkelled straight off my ladder in front of the villa where I swam with turtles by myself, I had a glass bottoms bath that overlooked the‚Ä¶"
"The most beautiful location, delicious food and amazing activities (snorkeling, surfing, sailing, diving...). The service is incredible: our GEM Aslah was great and all of the staff is extremely friendly, efficient and ready to cater for everyone‚Äôs needs. I loved biking around the resort and the aerial yoga class was great. Six Senses Laamu‚Äôs sustainability is also very impressive and educational. I highly recommend this resort to everyone and will miss waking up to an incredible view from my water villa."
"We decided that our citylife was turning unbearable as the holidays approached and the Maldives seemed the proper destination away from it all. Six Senses turned out to be the best choice we could have made: perfect location, attractive architecture, relaxed atmosphere, excellent service and food. Special mention is deserved for the ocean sports center: top quality equipment (sailboarding, kayaking and cat sailing) available free of charge. We also got a kick from our first surfing experience on the small local break thanks to the valid and super friendly instructors. Our dedicated GEM (General Emotions Manager) Aslah constantly made sure that we received all we expected and more!"
"I have spent a fantastic week: this place is a dream.  Great snorkeling: I saw turtles, sharks and fish every day with brilliant marine biologists. The food delicious and there is lots of variety - I am an Italian foodie and was very impressed. Rooms are idyllic with a personal entrance into the sea. Above all our general experience manager Aslah was very kind, helpful and always available. The chocolate tour with Avina was also a highlight. Last but not least I really appreciate that the resort is trying hard to take care of the environment, no plastic!"
"Our visit to the Six Senses in Laamu was a truly unforgettable one. Everything was perfect: starting with the villas overlooking the lagoon, with the crystal clear water where we spotted sharks, turtles and rays daily. The service was of the highest level, all the staff was polite, welcoming and warm. Everything was thought about to the smallest detail, it was truly amazing to see so much effort being put into the resort in order to create a seamless experience. All sport activities were great and cater for everyone, from relaxed snorkeling with marine biologists to surfing above the corals and doing areo yoga above the tropical rainforest. It is the most beautiful place I‚Äôve ever seen, and I can‚Äôt wait to come back. A special shoutout to Aslah, our GEM who accommodated our‚Ä¶"
"We're avid divers and have been looking for such a resort for years. The resort is everything we wanted - the place, the people, the marine life and ice-cream!   The dive centre is extremely well run - the boats are fantastic and very comfortable. There are plenty of dive sites around the resort so lots of variety. The centre is very well managed by Lauren and Sacha; while our dives guides were the very knowledgeable, efficient and charming Danny and Valerio. We really enjoyed the diving with them and most importantly - had a lot of fun! We also had the pleasure of diving with Lauren a few times (not to be missed if you get a chance!)  We stayed at an over-water villa which was very comfortable, had all that we needed and best of all - direct access to the water (from two places‚Ä¶"

My fianc√© and I came for our honeymoon directly after our wedding.  We had an absolutely amazing time relaxing in our villa which was so much bigger than we even expected!  The service was incredible from the moment we landed with everyone especially our GEM (guest experience maker.  We did the wine tasting with dinesh and I highly recommend!  Very incredible selection and knowledge of wine.  We also had an afternoon on our own private sunbank that was perfect!  Overall 10/10
We stayed at the six senses Maldives last weekend to celebrate our tenth wedding anniversary. It was our first holiday without kids in the last 7 years so we were really looking forward to this break. The staff at Six senses made it really special for us. Our Guest Experience Manager       (GEM as they call it here)Abdullah was a true gem indeed !! He was very kind and patient and made sure we had a great time. Everything was planned and organised as soon as we mentioned it . Thanks a lot Abdullah . . You are a sweet heart.

After two plane flights and a boat trip we arrived, minus shoes as it is a barefoot island, and were introduced to Auzam our Gem (Guest Experience Manager), who ensured everything was perfect for our stay and he went above and beyond to make it super special and very personal. We will miss his energy, enthusiasm and conversations which were incredibly interesting all about Maldivian life and history and we learnt so much including all about their efforts at conservation. There is a very impressive sustainability ethic.  All the staff were so welcoming and the atmosphere was exclusive and so friendly and warm. We also‚Ä¶"
"We did a lot of research before selecting Six Senses and we were not disappointed.  The over water villa was stunning, the island was magic, the snorkelling was the best we have ever done - and we have done a lot, the spa was great, the food was terrific.   The Mediterranean buffet we had one night was perhaps the best buffet I have ever had, principally because everything was being made on demand, so the bouillabaisse seafood was cooked and added while we waited and so with many of the other items.  All the food was fantastic.  The sustainability ethic of the resort is impressive and    But most of all, the staff were wonderful, from our G.E.M., Najah, the F&B Manager, Nasr who talked us through many of the food choices, Linu and Livaan at the Sip Sip bar, and so many others‚Ä¶"

We were welcomed by the resort manager then introduced to our Gem-Guest Experience Manager, Abdullah who is very helpful and friendly. He took care of us and provided exceptional support. I also would like to thank Neeta from the spa as I tried the hot stone massage which was out of this world as the room was like an outdoor one so I was listening to the waves all the time. The food in this resort is very tasty and it's worth menthoing that the arranged snorkeling trip through the water sports was really good witht our guide Kaya.

"The island is beautiful and very well maintained and our villa was really nice. All guests get bicycles which are a great way to move around the island. Breakfast was fantastic with plenty of food to choose from. I particularly liked Maldivian tuna curry which I had for breakfast every day. What I didn't like was that we weren't provided with all the information when we arrived. We stayed for 9 nights with our family and only at the end of our stay, a waiter mentioned that the kids under certain age eat for free. One waiter said it's kids under 6, another person said it's under 12. No one knew for sure and at this point we had many meals so I'm sure we're were overcharged for our kids. The other thing I didn't like was happy hour which I think they call slow hour. Again, we were‚Ä¶"
"Are you looking to go to the Maldives, look no further. Six Senses in Laamu is fantastic.  Everything is thought of to make the holiday the time of your life. My husband and I were discussing if we could think of any improvements to make the place even better. It was simply not possible.  The people, the friendliness, the service, the accommodation, the food, the surroundings, the activities etc etc. All is top notch.  And make sure you visit the spa and the gym. Hemant, in charge of fitness, is awesome. In his incredibly friendly way he pushes you in a way you didn‚Äôt think was possible.   We will be back. "

The overwater complex is great with lots of feature glass panels to look underwater.  Our GEM (Najah) was friendly and very helpful.  The spa experience (couples massage) was heaven and the view from the spa is unbeatable (like all views on the island).  The bikes were a great way to get around quickly.

We loved the laid back, no hassle atmosphere, surrounded by warm, friendly smiles across the resort - this is exactly what we need to unwind and forget about the world for a while.    We were impressed with the vast offerings around the resort.  It was ALMOST a challenge to figure out everything we wanted to do daily, paired with doing nothing and just absorbing the island life.

"We stayed in the Six Senses Laamu for 5 nights / 6 days for our honeymoon.  From the moment we landed in Make airport, the entire experience was fantastic. We were well looked after and arrived via plane / speedboat to the resort in good time. We were greeted by the management and shown across the incredible island.  Thor was our GEM as was brilliant - always met us at breakfast for a chat, helped us with any queries very promptly and booked the best restaurants in advance for us. he helped us select our activities.  Our water villa (18) was unforgettable! We have incredible sea-life every day (Mantaray, Shark, fish, etc), the water was so clear, warm, etc.  The food (both room service and in restaurant) was some of the best we've ever had.

Let me start by just saying how the sunsets , sunrises and just pure beauty of the scenery at Six Senses Laamu was indescribable.  I'm not one to usually take time out to appreciate those kinds of things but even I could not stop appreciating the sun, stars and ocean water.

"We are on our way home from the most amazing time at six senses Laamu, where we have spent the last 9 days. This was my 16th visit to the Maldives and this resort is the best I have visited. The island is stunning, staff fantastic, restaurants great, lots to do, and the snorkelling amazing - turtles, sharks, rays, beautiful fish all a dive away in the ocean. We will be back "
"Beautiful beyond, clear blue waters, first-rate scuba diving (according to our experienced friends), free ice cream every day with 42 flavors to choose from, amazing over-water villas, excellent spa services with gorgeous outdoor massage rooms, an abundance of food with incredible variety, and on and on.  BUT it is the people who make the experience something you will remember forever and will definitely want to go back for.  Marteyne is the General Manager who welcomed us as if we had known her for many years.  Auzam was our dedicated GEM (guest experience maker).  He was ever attentive without being intrusive.  He was proactive and thought of every possible thing we might want or need without us realizing we even wanted or needed it.  I literally teared up as he waved us‚Ä¶"
"When you first step foot on Six Senses Laamu, you're instantly blown away by its natural beauty and the overwhelmingly well-designed villas that make you feel that you're living on the edge of the water. Then the staff makes you feel completely at home by how friendly, warm and welcoming they are, every single one of them (shoutout to my GEM Shifu)!    But what I love most about Six Senses is how they embody sustainability from the get-go. Having multiple marine biologists on-site undertaking research, education and outreach with guests and the local community, they‚Äôre constantly monitoring the health of the sea life, minimizing waste, growing organic food, protecting seagrass + a % of profit goes towards marine conservation! What other resort do you get to hear all about Blue‚Ä¶"
"The six sense is a really  nice place to visit and enjoy your honeymoon, from food to water sports everything was just superb..we had a great honeymoon with the friendly staffs..Our GEM Aslah was the big part who made our stay memorable..He is a true gem..Fingers crossed for the next visit.."
The visit to Six Sense was a unique experience. The reception and service they offer is worth every penny. We were treated very well every day (special thanks to dear Aslah). The bungalow on the water is fantastic. I have no complaints. the food is fantastic too (the ice cream for the free guests). The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbeing self-supporting is also very cool
"It has been our first time in a Six Senses Resort and it has been perfect! The kindness of the team, the interesting activities, the quality of the massages, the facilities (gym was very good and well equipped), the diversity of food, healthy and high quality, the privacy in the room and the maintenance of the whole place! In 3 words: over the expectation! There is one important thing that make the difference and this is our Guest Experience who looked after us during the stay making sure everything was just perfect: thanks a million Abdhulla! "
My wife and I went back - this time without kids - for a fabulous 9 days in November. Six Senses Laamu was was even better than we remembered - the place is perfect for doing very little and the services are world class.  We were particularly impressed by the truly outstanding food in Leaf Restaurant where Chef Rodrico's level of cocking with great local ingredients is very high. The number of Michelin Star Chefs who have stayed only explains part of the excellence - this guy is talented. Our GEM Thor looked after everything for us while on the island - returning to normal life will be hard-hard-hard.
"We absolutely loved our stay at Six Senses!! We came for our honeymoon and from the moment we stepped on the island... we were in complete heaven. The staff is incredible. They never stop smiling and are extremely helpful with anything you need. They will bend over backwards for you. Our GEM, Abdulla, was the best. We were so sad to be leaving and will for sure be back next year!!"
"This 6 senses resort was literally everything i ever dreamed of. The water was arguably the most beautiful I've ever seen. It was also refreshing to be able to jump off our villa into the water. The help and food was amazing,  our guy Abdullah made this portion of our honey moon one that we'll never forget. Highly recommend."
Just finishing up our 7 day stay at Six Senses and it was a dream. Our Guest Experience Maker (GEM) Abdulla was amazing. He helped make our anniversary special and we didn‚Äôt have to worry about anything. Abdulla took care of reservations and anything else we needed. He went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and checked on us every day. The staff is  so friendly and helpful. The resort is well taken care of and so tranquil. I‚Äôve never been so relaxed. The food is great and everything here is all about mindfulness and healthy choices. Thank you for making our vacation great and tranquil.
"Six Senses Laamu needs to be 'felt' to be believed. Everything about this property is unique from the ambient music that sets the mood, the mouthwatering food (& 24/7 complimentary gelatoüòã) to nourish the body & palate, breathtakingly spectacular scenery everywhere you look, a magical day spa to rival any property in the world, a genuine eco friendly mission that translates through its guest programmes such as the marine biologist snorkling adventures, but most impressive is the impeccable, genuine & caring service provided by each & every staff member to ensure your utmost satisfaction in creating a memory to last a lifetime. This resort should be #1 on everybody's bucket list. I will definitely return. Thank you Six Sensesüôè"
"Our stay at Six Senses Laamu was amazing, more than we had expected before. Everything is prepared to make you feel like in paradise. The staff is really incredible, especially our GEM Abdulla, who was always taking care about everything we need, even some unexpected surprise! The diving center was also really helpful, introducing my wife to her first diving experience. Many thanks to Petty, Valerio and Hassan for their professional work! And there is much more to do: water sports, spa, gym, restaurants (don‚Äôt miss Japanese Zen and Mediterranean Leaf)... And of course, just relax on your villa with all the amenities, watching the sun set or having an outdoor bath or shower. The best way to know it is experience for yourself. It is well worth!"
"We just returned home from an incredible stay at Six Senses Laamu to celebrate our honeymoon/1st wedding anniversary.   Where to even begin? This place is truly magical. Pictures will never do justice to the beauty we witnessed on the island and the genuine hospitality of the entire staff.  Our GEM, Aslah, went above and beyond to make this trip extra special by helping us plan every single day. He made great recommendations for day activities, reserved each restaurant in advance so we had the opportunity to try them all and even added in extra touches to celebrate our anniversary/honeymoon.   Our recommendation is to truly seize each day there. The hotel offers plenty of activities and day trips, both complimentary and paid, to maximize your stay there. There are also 5‚Ä¶"
"Amazing experience, high level of details service and great food restaurants to hang in (Leaf was our favorite) Abdulla (our Great Experience Maker) had such a good service attitude and suggestions throughout our visit"
"I don't even know from where to start explaining my experience in this beautiful resort. Is it the people who work there, who are the most hard working bunch of happy faces you'll ever see, or is it the paradise that follows you wherever you find yourself on this heaven island. One thing you will notice staying there is that Senses Laamu is for sure one of not so many who take such a good care of environment,  and have such a good success in the sustainability department. You will definitely return home with a different mindset of doing your part in helping as much as you can to our blue planet.  Paradisiac beaches, fifty shades of blue water, bushy coconut jungle, colorful tiny wildlife crossing your path while cycling around the island. These are the things you end up‚Ä¶"
"This resort has the wow factor! If you‚Äôre looking for a luxurious break in a breathtaking location, with Michelin star quality food and service that cannot be faulted, then look no further.   The welcome off the speedboat is like a homecoming and you‚Äôre greeted like old friends.   The water villas over the ocean are spectacular and you‚Äôll never tire of the view. The design of the rooms and the whole resort is beautiful and attention is paid to every little detail.   Dining out is a real treat and the chefs spoil you with so much choice and gorgeous dishes. The fresh fruit, salads and fish are a highlight.   Every guest has a GEM (guest experience maker) looking after them during their stay and we were lucky enough to have Aslah looking after us. He was on hand at all times and‚Ä¶"
"If you‚Äôre looking for a luxury stay at a resort that takes Sustainability, the environment, and local community seriously then look no further than six senses Laamu. I really cannot fault this place; it is incredible. And the more I learnt (eg. ‚ÄòBack of house tour‚Äô) the more impressed I became with the lengths they are going to maintain a low environmental footprint and uplift the surrounding local communities. They have a marine and sustainability team (‚ÄòMUI‚Äô) that are passionate about making the world a better place. I am so privileged to have stayed here. Thanks to all the staff - including my ‚ÄòGuest Experience Maker‚Äô Aslah - for making this trip a memory I dwell on many times when stuck in mud office back home."
"Could not fault anything about this resort. It was amazing. Fantastic snorkelling right off the villa, sensational food, staff were super friendly. Loved the bike riding and simplicity. Would highly recommend."
"Came to SSL with my wife for our honeymoon/1st wedding anniversary and couldn‚Äôt have been happier. By far the best experience I‚Äôve ever had at any hotel around the world.  From the onset: SSL is the only hotel in the Laamu atoll, making it extra exclusive. The island is insanely beautiful and the architecture is incredible, embracing all the local elements. It is also the main employer of all the local islands, and the people are the nicest I‚Äôve ever met - never had so many people greet me every time they saw me. They were also genuinely interested in knowing us, making it a super personal experience.  Our GEM (Guest Experience Manager) Aslah was the most incredible host, going above and beyond to make our trip extra special. Will genuinely miss talking to and learning from him!‚Ä¶"
"Our stay at Six Senses resort on the Laamu atoll was absolutely amazing. The staff is incredible( especially our GEM Abdulla) and make the stay extraordinary from making sure you have the right pillows to planning almost anything you want to do. The island, resort and restaurants are beautifully kept and clean and the restaurants offer a wide variety of dietary options.  Our favorite part of the trip was going barefoot the entire time. I‚Äôm not sure that my explanation does it justice. You have to truly experience for yourself, but I can promise you that you won‚Äôt be disappointed."
"This place has it all. Amazing property, mostly overwater villas. Beautifully fitted out. Brilliant restaurants  and spa. Fantastic kids club. 500 friendly, attentive, smiling and relaxed staff for 97 rooms. Totally barefoot and relaxed. Turquoise water. Stargazing- dolphins - manta Rays - turtles - reefs - Ice cream and chocolate studio - just fabulous"
We have the best holiday in this wonderful resort.Excellent hospitality and services from all hotel department.Our GEM name ‚Äú Niuma‚Äù was nice and very friendly. Breakfast and dinner at Chill bar was really tasty.  We are definitely going to come back to Six Sense Laamu.
"We have been in the ocean water villa, sunset oriented: just about better that what we expeted. impressed in the structure, service, a person is totally dedicated to the guest,  bathrooms are incredible. in the rooms and in most of the public areas there are panes of glass to allow whatching the see. Diving is amaizing: sites and management: just the best I ever experienced. Investment and involment in the invorimental. 4 restaurants garanties great choices. Good surfing I noticed extras are very much expensive timing of services at restaurants, excetp for Leaves, are quite slow"
"We‚Äôve had such a magical experience in the Six Senses Laamu. Everything is amazing (room, service, food, activities). It is a very special place for couples and families who look for relaxing, be in contact with nature and love! For sure the best place for a honeymoon!"
"We had a spectacular honeymoon on Six Senses Laamu. The overwater villa is superb and the hotel has a very laid back atmosphere. Also, great sights for scuba diving and snorkeling. At Six Senses Laamu there is a genuine concern to be eco-friendly and you can also learn a lot from the team of marine biologists that work there. In all, you can get a taste of everything. You can go for some diving adventures, or chill in your room. You can also have great food and drinks at the many restaurant options provided by the hotel. We had the time of our lives and are returning very very relaxed and rested!"
"It's hard to explain just how special Six Senses Laamu is. It is a true paradise and absolutely everything was perfection - the marine life, the hospitality, the food (oh the food!)  The setting and architecture are truly 5 star. We stayed on Jetty C, which is the furthest away from the main hub with a remote feeling - around 10 min cycle. The water was slightly more choppy next to the waves, but still swimmable. Jetty A is closer with calmer seas but more overlooked if closer to the beach.  There are three distinct areas to snorkel. The house reef has a beautiful drop off. The coral is recovering from a bleaching event, but there still a wonderful range of fish, turtles, rays, small sharks and other marine life. Between the jettys there is sea grass, where the turtles eat‚Ä¶"
Six senses has exceeded our very high expectations at all levels. The experience that you get at the hotel and the activities you can chose are just amazing.  We would repeat for sure in the future. Thanks six senses team for making it possible!
"Stop what you are doing and book Six Senses Laamu...you will not regret it!  Since we have come home my wife and I can't stop talking about how perfect our honeymoon was and how we can't wait to go back.    The resort is pure relaxation with breathtaking views.  All of the food is insanely delicious with plenty of different options to choose from.  However, the number one thing that stands about Six Senses Laamu is their customer service.  Every member of their staff go above and beyond to make sure you are enjoying your stay to the fullest.  They all really genuinely care about each and every guest and it showed in every interaction we had with them.  It was always a pleasant one.  A special thank you to our GEM, Thohir, who made our stay extremely memorable (If you can request‚Ä¶"
"We were on our honeymoon, and spent the first half in Bali which was quite perfect. But Six Senses Laamu just set a new definition to perfection. The hospitality is just out of this world!  You get a dedicated ‚ÄúGuest Experience Manager‚Äù who is there whenever you need anything. Our GEM, Aslah, was so helpful and was proactive in recommending activities and various tips and advices that made our experience exceptional.  Another highlight here was the food, almost 5 restaurants with different cuisines offering a Michelin-like experience!  We are definitely returning one day for our anniversary :)"
"I have never been to such an amazing place in my life before, truly heaven on earth will definitely come back very soon, i would this resort the number 1 place to consider for going to take the time to destress and be free"
"A lot of hidden gems  in this resort, witch deserve to discover.   We recomand this resort to everyone who like wild nature , to descover turtles nests, how are hatchings, and many more...  Thank ‚Äò s for our GEM , and all the personals.  We had a wonderful week! Good luck and all the best!  Calin and family"
"What an amazing island resort. We celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary at Laamu and had an amazing time.  From the moment we were collected at the airport by the resort staff everything exceeded our expectations - which were high after talking to prior guests.  Food was great, service by all staff was friendly & top notch facilities were excellent. Was paradise.  Food - so much variety and a focus on fresh healthy foods. We did the half board of breakfast & dinners. With such large meals & plenty of snack options during the day this was all we needed. Surfing was fun and really well organised by the Tropic Surf Team. Got a few uncrowded surfs in. Would recommend as perfect for a surfer on a getaway with partner where trip priority is not just a surf trip.  Overwater Villa was‚Ä¶"
"Just wanted to share that again our 2 weeks vacation  was terrific and extremely relaxing. Besides the impeccable service attitude overall there are three areas I would like to highlight: 1. Tropicsurf is second to none. We highly appreciate basically everything and actually we do not know what you could do better. Tropicsurf guides are excellent / as always. Thank you Josh(s), Saif 2. Deep Blue Divers: also here we really value how you care about the every single dive trip. Hints re under water photography from Sascha - priceless. Pls keep the passion. 3. GEM: thank you Mila - great service"
"The resort Staff is very professional, friendly and helpful. My special appreciation and commendation goes to ‚ÄúNi‚Äù (our GEM) who was very friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean with very nice furniture and with all amenities you may need. I would like to also compliment the housekeeping and room service for their friendly, prompt, efficient and personalized attention at all times. The ‚Äúlongitude‚Äù restaurant had a top quality breakfast with fresh everything and a nice selection of cereals, cheese, fresh bread etc., and well catered to by the morning staff, it also provided an excellence buffet dinner during Asian market night. Don‚Äôt miss chocolate and wine tasting program, this is a wonderful experience for a chocolate lover. The pool and all other facilities were amazing. ‚Ä¶"
fabulous resort with first class service. fantastic beach villa. enjoyed snorkeling and excellent food. great staff: friendly and authentic. taking great care regarding sustainable tourism. Special thanks to Aslah (GEM) and Lin (Spa) who made our stay very special.
"We stayed for 6 nights at Six Senses Laamu, and it was excellent.   The weather was a bit changeable in mid-October, but everything about the resort was great - including the rooms, facilities, food and service.   A highlight was the kids club for our 7 year old daughter - they had a full programme of fun events which meant she wanted to go there straight from breakfast every day.  Overall, an excellent resort - we hugely enjoyed our time there and highly recommend it."
"I had a great chance to be at my dream destination, Six Senses Laamu with my family and it was just like we have been heaven, stunnig view and amazing staffs there.  My GEM was 'Ni' and she was incredible. She had made our trip even better by taking great care of us. She was my private snorkeling leader which allowed me a great chance to see sea turtle and also the hatching.  Best trip ever and surely we would love to re-visit there."
"Being back at the office is hard, but even harder after our last stop at Six Senses Laamu. Incredible and unforgettable experience from the very first moment that we landed in Male.  All members of staff are excellent, always willing to help and very pleasant. We had a good surprise when we were assigned a Spanish GEM, Daniel, who took care of everything we needed during our stay.  We enjoyed very much snorkeling with the marine biologist since you get to see beautiful things and learn about the marine life. Also, any Spa treatment should be a MUST on your list. With regards to the facilities and F&B, everything is perfect. We could enjoy incredible breakfast and lovely dinners in all of the different restaurants.  It was undoubtedly the best way to finish our honeymoon and‚Ä¶"
"Great resort, with attention to the most tiny details, making our stay truly outstanding. Great surf team (Josh & Josh & Fiona) able to find the right option everyday according to wind and swell conditions. The Spa & Yoga team is also amazing, offering diverse courses, tailored to everyone's abilities. Would recommend the resort without any hesitation.  R  "
"The 6 senses in Laamu is a place you have to discover.  Great location, wonderful resort and perfect service. There are activities for everyone at anytime.  We enjoyed, kids enjoyed! We‚Äôll come back.  See you soon"
"Six Senses Laamu was a wonderful place to spend our honermoon. You are treated wonderfully since the airplane lands in Male by hotel staff. Every detail is taken care of, from the begginign to the end of the stay, all staff is extremely pleasant. Breakfast and facilities were all perfect. Our GEM Daniel was really nice and made us feel really comfortable as he took care of everything. It was important for us to have Spanish speakers and we could also do certain activities in our language.  Finally, location is espectacular and we enjoyed very much the snorkeling with the marine biologist. Is better if we don't disclose anymore and you can go and discover by yourself this wonderful hotel."
"We spent 5 days of our honeymoon at this fantastic hotel. The staff was really friendly and they helped us in everything they could. In this barefoot hotel you have your own GEM(a person in charged of your room that is 24/7 available for whatever you need), the 4 restaurants to eat that are amazing the same as the room service and having breakfast is such and experience. You also have many water sports and different kinds of activities to do, dome of them are complimentary. Having a massage at the spa is such an experience. For my next time in the Maldives i will repeat at Six Senses Laamu."
I can only recommend this out of the ordinary hotel!  I have been to so many different places in the world but never anywhere like this.  GO GO GO you will never regret it - It is MAGICAL! It is PERFECT for families traveling with kids as you REALLY REALLY feel they are (more than) welcome 
Best place for 120% non glitter luxury relax and re energizing holiday with sense for biodiversity marine life education family friendly couple friendly.... best holiday. We have been 4 times... and we will be back!!!!
"To celebrate THE moment in Life .....SIX SENSES Laamu is THE  place.  For this lovely resort has an unparallel serene feel to the place, service uncompromised...and endless options to make it unforgettable in every way....words can't do justice...all I can say. DONT have second thoughts"
"We were in Six Senses Laamu for 6 days and we had an amazing time!!!  Everybody was so friendly, the food was amazing and the room was like no other.   When we got to the hotel we were welcomed by a big part of the staff then they asigned a ‚Äúgem‚Äù a person who took care of all our needs during the whole stay, his name was Abdulla, he was amazing!!  He showed us around, took us to our room which was amazing!!!!  Everything is made out of natural materials!!  We had a room with our own pool and also could get into the ocean whenever we wanted to swim or snorkel.  Snorkeling was amazing I could not stop watching all the fish just in front of our villa.   All the activities have very nice people helping us make it easy.  We learned how to surf  which I never thought I would at my age‚Ä¶"
"This is by far the best hotel, resort I've ever experienced!!! The place is simply fantastic; the people, the food and the accommodations are beyond your dreams. The overall experience in the day to day, is a complete lifestyle changer; the offering of services, scuba, surf, snorkel, and many others will keep you busy all day. Resting is absolute warranty in its fantastic villas. The people warmth and care about servicing the clients, is of highest level. To summarize, this is a MUST and a CAN'T MISS."
"Right from the moment you get off the plane you‚Äôre looked after attentively. The staff were all really helpful and the service was 5*.  There are an overwhelming amount of hotels to choose from in Maldives, all looking as luxurious as each other. After sifting through multiple reviews of different hotels, we settled on the six senses. The reason being the island felt not too big and not too small and overall it felt the right balance of what we were looking for - things to do and good rooms. We liked the fact that you could cycle around and there were activities to do if we so wished- like trying out surfing (which we 100% recommend doing). Plus they had a few choices for restaurants. (We tend to get a bit fed up on holiday if we have to eat in the same place every night). Our‚Ä¶"
"Wow Six Senses is definitely 6+++ star! We were so privileged to have been your guests for two weeks.  From the start in Male, being met by a Six Senses representative who took care of everything, which was very welcome as we had been traveling for over 15 hours by this stage, to the end of our stay, we could not fault anything, it truly is amazing. The flight to Kadhdhoo was fast and we were honoured to witness a newlywed couple being greeted by the community with singing and dancing. The staff on the boat are fantastic. Especially in helping me to get on / off the boat as I am partially disabled. It was an idyllic 15 minute ride to Laamu. We were provided with the most gorgeous fresh lemonade and coconut.    Then the most amazing welcome greeted us on arrival at Six Senses‚Ä¶"

"Impeccable in every way, service, structure, food, cleanliness, beauty and activities.  Staff always very polite, helpful, smiling and always ready to serve us.  Wonderful room, comfortable, clean and integrated with nature, as well as all hotel facilities.  Wonderful, varied, tasty food, carefully prepared, coming straight from the hotel's own garden!  Concerned about sustainability, they seek to integrate tourism, the local population and nature in the most positive way possible!  The hotel cares about and conserves marine life with educational activities, information, research and protection.  I had the opportunity to see the birth of sea turtles!  It was very exciting!  Six Senses allowed me to explore all my senses and discover unexplored ones.  Thank you for the‚Ä¶"

It was an unforgettable experience!!!! Hotel is the most beautiful one we ever been!!!! Staff was always ready to help us and always friendly as well!!!

Hope to come back soon!!!!!
"We had a fantastic time.  The resort is absolutely beautiful, but the best part is the people...  friendly, kind, and considerate.  The surf is fun and TropicSurf does a great job.  Our host, Abdulla was the kindest person you could ever meet.  He made sure our trip was as good as it could be.  It just doesn‚Äôt get much better."
A GEM system is nice for the resorts. Our GEM Abdulla organise our meal perfectly. We enjoy walking on the beach and looking the crabs which are interesting for us. The massage was great for honeymoon couples. Chocolate cake was surprised us and it taste good.
"Six Senses is a one of a kind resort, the thought that goes behind the entire operation is remarkable. From the system of self sustainability that has been built on the resort, to the intricate detail in every facet of the villas, restaurants and beaches. The 6th sense experience will feel like a dream, but I promise it is very real.   Beauty awaits you around every corner, and no matter what you need, all of the staff is there to help you and assist. Want to learn more about the sea life, ask one of the many marine biologist, need help deciding on a dinner wine, the Sommelier has got you covered.   The cherry on top of the entire experience is having a GEM assigned to you when you arrive. The GEM essentially makes sure you never stress about a single thing during your trip,‚Ä¶"
"Everything was 5 starts. The location, the Villa, the food, the activities and the people. The staff took care of every single detail and our GEM Mila was outstanding. Best holidays ever! We will be back!"
"We couldn‚Äôt have dreamed up a more relaxing, romantic and luxurious place to spend our honeymoon. After reading many reviews and looking at many photos, it still far exceeded our expectations. Ali was a tremendous host who made our stay feel effortless, including making restaurant reservations and hunting down a misplaced wedding band. Josh, Fiona and Saif were great surf coaches and made sure I got some of the best empty waves of my life. Every dish we had was excellent at each of the 4 restaurants we tried. We appreciate how well kept the island is, the focus on sustainability and marine life. We hope we‚Äôll be lucky enough to come back soon!"
"Absolutely spectacular! From start to finish everything was perfect - amazing overwater villas with a beautiful lagoon around them, excellent service from the staff, great food (especially Zen) and very eco-friendly ethos. I think this vacations going to be hard to beat!"
"Unique paradise with friendly and very caring staff, everything is thinked in detail.  Incredible international breakfast, lovely options to have diner, and activities to relax and enjoy yourself. Specially Aslah our GEM (guest experience malee) is very carring with us."
"Everyting is incredible, mainly the staff that makes you feel as an special guest, also the details in rooms and the food at the restaurants make a very relaxing and interesing stay. Definetly, is one of the best island i have ever been."
"Dear Six Senses Laamu - our family!   This was our second visit. Our first visit left a lasting impression and we chose to revisit this year - something we never do!  My new fiance and I shared the most special moment on the private sand bank as he proposed.  Our guest experience manager, Shifa, made this so special for us.  I know why my fiance picked his proposal spot at Six Senses Laamu - the place is indescribable; and I don't just mean by luxury standards and idyllic location.   I mean the staff are out of this world! Genuine smiles, happy to see you, trained to a high standard, so polite but not robotic. I have never seen so many genuine, warm, smiley people all working as one team. They are there when you need them but also not over the top! This is the cherry on the‚Ä¶"
"We had the most wonderful honeymoon in what can only be described as pure paradise. The food is delicious, staff are so kind (especially Abdulla who took such great care of us - booking us a table on the beach for my birthday and organising a cake :). Not wearing shoes for a week, cycling around the island every day and doing the back of house tour were highlights for us. It really is a very special place, made even better by its sustainable nature, with herb garden and chickens. Our ocean water villa was beautiful - with stunning views and fab snorkelling. We would highly recommend - thank you so much Six Senses Laamu! Hattie and Sam x"
"Visited Six Senses Laamu for six nights in an overwater villa.  Room was beautifully appointed with fabulously comfortable bed.  Loved the over water views from the toilet and outdoor tub as well as from the outstanding breakfast buffet.  The outdoor lounging areas were great too, but if I had to do it over again, I'd splurge for the overwater villa with pool.  Our GEM Arif was amazing; my husband was ill and he went out of his way to be of assistance.  Steven and Petty and the rest of the team at the dive shop were great in sharing their knowledge of the diving in the area and we had some fantastic dives off spacious comfortable dive boats.  Ice cream shop was awesome, loved the bikes to get around with, and enjoyed movie night on the beach.  Hope to come back again and can't‚Ä¶"
"After many research on various resorts in Maldives, I am really happy that I've selected Six Senses.  The GEMs and staffs on 20 mins boat ride and short brief during boat ride already gave me the feeling that it's gonna be a great place even before I arrive at the island. The resort is extremely beautiful and the welcome party made the first impression very heartwarming and lovely. Coming from a busy city Singapore, the concept of entire resort is just so raw and gorgeous and my partner and I felt extremely pleased and happy.  We walked barefoot entirely around the resort during our 5 nights stay.  The food in all restaurants were very good and ingredients are always fresh and tasty.

"I had the best experience at Six Sense. From the ambiance of the restaurants to the privacy of the rooms, everything was pretty perfect. The villa we had was situated in beautiful place overlooking at the resort as well as the beautiful environment. The barefoot concept was a nice touch. And the GEM availability was what made the whole experience welcoming and warm."
"A recent trip to the Six Senses Laamu in the Maldives did not disappoint. The island itself is stunning and although this is technical off-season, the weather held up and did not hinder our experience.   The food and facilities were great but it was the Six Senses Laamu team that really made this trip a 10 out of 10 experience. From being extremely accommodating to each and every request to their almost psychic ability to anticipate any need in advance of request, the team were absolutely amazing. Each and every team interaction was professional, personal and genuine.   I must say that our Guest Experience Maker, Arif, was the star of the show. There was not a moment when he didn‚Äôt have our best interest at heart and go above and beyond. I wish that I had Arif around in my‚Ä¶"
"This was our first but not last time to a six senses hotel and resort. The service from all departments was exceptional and truly enhanced our romantic holiday to celebrate my big birthday! Every want and whim was anticipated by our Guest Experience Maker, Arif who gave us excellent recommendations and genuine service. His role was to ensure we had a holiday tailored to our specific needs and requests and he certainly fulfilled this role beyond our expectations.  Not only is this a beautiful resort,  it really is the staff that takes this experience to another level! Thank you to Arif for taking such good care of us, Jailam and Muhammad for a idyllic seafood meal on the beach and every member of staff we encountered during our holiday. Make sure you try the macerated berries‚Ä¶"
"Amazing stay I'n six sense laamu, from food to water sports is amazing. We had the best holiday ever. For sure we will come back soon. All the staffs in the resort are so kind and helpful. A very special thank to our GEM Aslah who made our journey unforgettable. He was just ready for everything possible. highly recommended üôèü§ó"
"The hotel is amazing. The island is beautiful and so is the rustic architecture of the hotel. Rooms are very comfortable, service is great and the food is very good. Everything here there is impeccable. "
"Laamu is everything you dream about. From the beauty of the Island to the kindness of alle the staff. The villas are a home away from home, the food is a great and tasty experience and the spa is something you will always remember."
"An amazing place... we don‚Äôt have any other words... is like a paradise.... üòä  All employees are very friendly and kind.. our Gem Shifa (Shifu) was very helpful and nice, ready every Moment to assist us... Food was very fancy and amazing. A place that you leave your heart ‚ù§Ô∏è"
The hotel was very welcoming and the service was very good. The massages were amazing. The island was maintained very well and it was easy to get around with bikes. The food was also good and there were a few restaurants with different options.
"Best vacation place ever! We went there for our Honeymoon and besides the view, the service is excellent! They make you feel like home from the moment you arrive at the airport until you leave! PS. If you can pick Najah as your Gem"
"Six senses, if you think about it this is a perfect name. We have five senses so the last one can be the some the others. Every soul will have a different sixth sense in the end of the experience. Here, we were (me and my wife) exposed and estimulated in touch, since the start when the transfer pick us up and asked us to walk without shoes in the sand (no shoes concept). After that our visions, hearing and smelling mixed up with the nature, natural landscape, animals and off course the magical water. We felt a special connection with the environment, they way our society should be.  The food was incredible amazing always. Our taste sense was surprised in every single meal.  As a frequent travelers (+ 50 countries visited) we experienced one of our top 3 ranked breakfast (taste‚Ä¶"
"We just got back from Six Senses Laamu last week, and let me tell you - it was amazing!  My husband and I travel a lot and most of our travels are go-go-go, back packing, etc. This is one of the first vacations we took that we actually took the whole week to do nothing but relax and Six Senses Laamu was the perfect place to do just that.   Pros: The staff was amazing and so accommodating. So many of the staff addressed us by our first names, even ones that we never came in direct contact with. If we needed anything, our GEM (Guest Experience Maker) was only a call away. The food was amazing, especially at Leaf. The breakfast buffet was also to die for and the free ice cream was definitely a plus. We stayed in the Laamu Overwater Villa and it was perfect. We could see the villas‚Ä¶"
"The team at Six Senses Laamu are wonderful! Nothing is too much trouble even for a difficult guest such as myself,  Two things that really sets this resort apart from the rest are: Sustainable Island living - the efforts that are made to reduce the impact of tourism is certainly impressive. Micro-agriculture producing salad crops, mushrooms, eggs etc the outreach team who are helping the local population with education, support and how to deal with the ever increasing problem of waste plastic disposal by offering credible alternatives. The dive centre is World class! I have visited the island a few times yet on this last visit they managed to find new, exciting sites for me!  If there was a 5*+ rating then Six Senses would certainly get it!"
"Was an amazing experience! With a lot of beautiful landscape, great food, impressive structure and excepcional service !! We loved so much and were the most incredible days that we spent ! In special the GEM Abdulla was the most attentive and careful staff in the resort! I really recommend everything ! "
"I can't begin to describe how special this place is. Words aren't enough to thank each and every member of Six Senses staff. The resort is amazingly placed in one of the most beautiful island I've ever visited. Our experience began on the boat where they gently asked us to take your shoes off, and until the day we left, we wee barefoot anywhere in the hotel. Our GEM Thor was really kind and helpful, our surf instructors Ben, Umar and Eli taught us through and incredible 4-day surf experience. Our dive instructor Dani graduated us to Open Water Divers and every single detail through our entire stay was PERFECT. Paradise does exist. Paradise is here at Six Senses Laamu!! Can't wait to come back!!"
"Our Six Senses Laamu experience was unforgettable. We were constantly impressed by the passion that resort staff had for serving guests. It is a ""no stone unturned"" type of experience where your needs are satisfied before you knew you had any needs! The overwater villas are very unique and all of the facilities had a clean and sustainable style. I especially enjoyed my relaxing spa experiences and the fascinating back of house tour with Megan."
"OMG, all in all - this is the most amazing place on Earth. Food is better then great, villa‚Äôs are the best ever tryed - staff is proffesional and more a delight... this is a must try üôèüèª  Travel to Lamuu, take a bike ride - and enjoy heaven on Earth ü•Ç"
"We stayed in a beautiful overwater sunset villa just feet away from beautiful reef  The service at Six Senses is  beyond the expectation. We never had to lift  a luggage and the staff expertly anticipated any needs we had. Every guest is assigned a Guest Experience Maker (GEM) to ensure a uniquely tailored stay. Our GEM, Ravah  know what we need we don‚Äôt need to ask anything he will arrange   we need ,dinner booking as well Perfect place to celebrate honeymoon we will com back next year and we want Ravaah to be our gem, hotel is not very crowded,"
"We‚Äôve just spent 7nights here and very sad to be leaving. We stayed in a water villa on jetty B on a half board basis, which was perfect for us. We got to swim and see turtles right off our jetty. The house reef is also excellent lots of fish and colourful coral. Our gem Abdulla was very friendly and helpful booking our dinners before our arrival meaning we got to eat at all of the restaurants as they soon get booked up. He checked in with us twice a day to see if we needed anything and to let us know of anything going on for that day. This is our 2nd visit to the Maldives this year, and I will defo come back! Hopefully to this resort. The food in this hotel is exceptional, be sure not to miss the Asian street market dinner! You must come here and see it for yourself! Perfect‚Ä¶"
"Let me start by saying, I never write reviews but Six Senses really deserved one!  From the moment we stepped onto the boat to get to Six Senses Laamu, the service we experienced was second to none. When we reached the island, we arrived to a warm welcome from our GEM Shifu. Having experienced butlers in hotels all around the world, it was easy to say that Shifu is in a league of her own. She knew exactly what was needed and when - she was the perfect balance of being there for us and giving us privacy. Shifu was constantly anticipating what we needed and no request was ever too big or small. For example, Shifu asked me about my dietary requirements at check in and to my surprise, when we were dining in the restaurants, even the waiters knew about my requirements. She handled‚Ä¶"
"This place is incredible - favourite hotel I have ever visited. It is so special! The water villas are beautiful, the staff are SO kind and friendly, and Abdulla is the best Butler EVER. He is heaven! The general manager Marteyne is amazing and looks after all the guests beautifully. It is the most special place in the Maldives and I cannot fault a single thing!"
"We stayed in a beautiful overwater sunset villa just feet away from the vibrant house reef. Our favorite feature was definetely the private open air outdoor shower, accessible via step ladder directly from the crystal clear water below. The service at Six Senses is unparalleled. We never had to lift a suitcase and the staff expertly anticipated any needs we had. Every guest is assigned a Guest Experience Maker (GEM) to ensure a uniquely tailored stay. Our GEM, Thohir was extremely attentive and helpful, constantly coordinating our dinner reservations and activities so all we had to do was show up! I especially enjoyed the surfing and diving around the island. Deep Blue Divers and Tropicsurf had knowledgable and experienced staff to guide, making sure everyone had a fun and safe‚Ä¶"
"Good experience for couples and water sports is pretty nice, villa facility is perfect, Leaf restaurant in Six Sense Laamu made delicious meal, Gem call Thor is really helpful and make us very comfortable."
"For our honeymoon we choose the Six Senses Laamu Resort on the Maldives, because of its very nice reputation and the idea of a sustainable way of holiday. It was a memorable vacation and the nice Six Senses crew did the extra mile in serving, food and excursions! Thank you very much and we looking forward to come back:)"
"We just got back from the Six Senses Laamu and had a wonderful stay. This is our fourth Six Senses property and this one was our best experience so far. From arrival to departure, all the encounters that we had with the staff were positive and seemed genuine. We would like to give special thanks to our GEM Mafaz, who was always there for us and arranged everything immediately.   We stayed in an Ocean Overwater Villa with an infinity view. It was located further away from the main restaurant (Jetty C) so it was very private and quiet. One of the special feature of the villa is an outdoor bathroom with a glass bottom bathtub. We frequently saw some of the marine life right from our terrace - sting ray, jelly fish, coral fish...   The resort offers a very wide selection of‚Ä¶"
"If you‚Äôre seeking a destination with excellent diving, plenty to keep a sporty 16 year old busy and a very laid back luxury feel, then this is the perfect place.  If you like to be spoiled but DON‚ÄôT like corporate &/or ostentatious resorts then this is the place for you!  The team who work at the resort are first rate and they are clearly at the heart of the island‚Äôs success.  Nothing was every too much trouble for anyone, whether that was our GEM (Afrah was awesome), the dive centre, surf centre, water sports centre, restaurants etc etc. Everyone wanted to do anything they could to make our holiday as perfect as possible and it was all done in a very genuine way - nothing contrived at all.    In terms of the resort itself, then the accommodation was amazing - so comfortable,‚Ä¶"
"Stayed for 9 nights in a Ocean Water Villa, which have spectacular views. Would definitely recommend, all the resort facilities are first class and there are plenty of dining options. All the food and service exceeded expectations. No complaints at all.  "
"Wonderful experience from start to finish. Met in the airport and chaperoned throughout. virtually all staff from your resort were superb and went beyond expectations! resort itself was magical. Excellent food too, especially in the Leaf and Japanese restaurants, particularly in Leaf though."
"Our Stay during the Easter Season in Laamu was awesome!! Again!! We were here allready in 2012 whitout kids...  Our Room was just fantastic!! The Kids Club was awesome!! Our Kids normally don't like Hotel Kids Club, but the stuff was sooo nice and caring, so our Kids asked Always when can they go again! That was super nice and easy for us!! The Food in all Restaurants was excellent!! I was so suprised About the Vietnamese Restaurant! The Food was excellent!! The whole staff was sooo friendly, like in every Six Senses we have been!!

"Water villas and private beach houses are so well designed in conformity with natural surroundings that you can really relax your body and mind.   Everything offered here is extraordinary and beyond your expectation.  At spa center, gym, and all restaurants can you enjoy spectacular views.  You will find 5 days too short and don't want to leave when you have to.   If the resort can charge a bit less, I am sure it would be the best resort in the world."
"This was my second visit to this fantastic eco friendly resort and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. It is difficult to think of a more perfect location and resort either as a luxurious and unbelievably romantic week away or a more active luxury surf or dive holiday. I took my two teenage sons this time and if anything and if possible, it was even better than the first time partly because we were a bit more active, and partly because I think the food has got even better (and it was already great). It has everything - your own non-intrusive GEM (guest experience manager) to make sure everything is perfect, white secluded coral beaches, a house left hand break and great surfing, a house reef and amazing diving, it even has a 4 g soccer pitch hidden away to play soccer against the staff if you‚Ä¶"
"Laamu was everything you would expect from the Maldives, turquoise waters, white sandy beaches, beautiful weather.  We have stayed at other Six Senses resorts and love the sustainability and well being ethos that at at its core.  What truly differentiated this trip was the genuine friendliness and attentiveness of the staff, the amazing food and spacious accommodation.  Our GEM, Zimam, was a pleasure to deal with and looked after us extremely well without being overbearing (which we have found at other Six Senses resorts).   The selection and quality of food during our stay was second to none, LEAF and the Mediterranean evening at Longitude were excellent, although Chill Bar was our favorite - highly recommend the calamari which was the best we have ever had!  We cannot say‚Ä¶"
"What an amazing experience our family had this past August, staying at Six Senses Laamu! We stayed at an over-water villa on the last jetty (Jetty C), and were amazed at the amount of amenities, truly genuine staff, and all the amazing bits of nature we were able to experience for our week stay!  There was always something to do, even if it was just relaxing pool/beachside! We took our 7-year old daughter Addison, with us, and she absolutely adored Kid's Club, and all the staff: Lala and Jovie! Every hour in Kids Club featured a new/different activity, and 95% of the activities were free of additional cost! Our daughter enjoyed fishing, exploring the neighboring island, making crafts, henna, and cooking! She also was able to attend 12 kids movie nights/kid buffets and we were‚Ä¶"
"This is a very beautiful property.  The entire main hotel is built over water and a submerged reef. There are land villas and 3 jetties with over water villas.  The hotel and jetties all connect to an island where there is spa/gym, vegetable gardens, restaurants, pool area with beautiful beach, fresh juice wellness area.  Everyone gets a bike with your initials to ride around the island.  There are over 5 restaurants on the property where you can have very different food each night.  For a hotel that needs to import a lot of food you won;t feel that at all as the chefs are meticulous about their food preparation and choices.  Beach barbeque is very well done in a near perfect setting.  One of the hotel signatures is free ice cream any time with some really crazy number of‚Ä¶"
"This was our Honeymoon destination and it has exceeded our expectations by far. Everything was perfect, the food , activities as well as the service. What amazed me the most was our GEM Najah , who had been allocated to us. He provided us with everything we needed, even before asking and gave us suggestions for what we could do in each given time period.  Thank you so much for this wonderful and magical experience.  See you again at our anniversary ;)"
"We were blown away by the location, Six Senses and all of the staff. We were never left wanting and the care and attention we got from everyone made our honeymoon truly unforgettable. Special thanks to Najah our attentive and polite GEM who even sorted out a little cake to commemorate our honeymoon. The chefs too, especially for the great lobster BBQ: best meal of the week!"
"My Wife and I booked the Six Sense Lamu in Maldives for our honey moon. We had the most wonderful honey moon because of the Six Sense Lamu and what it has to offer. The room was stunning and had amazing and relaxing views. The staff was amazing especially Shifu , CJ and the best bartenders Sagar and Warren. I highly recommend to check our this beautiful Resort. The staff were incredibly friendly and the service was excellent - a visit to the Six Sense Lamu is a must !  - we will be back!"
"This is a first-class resort - the House Reef is excellent and very accessible - the food, and choice of food, is outstanding (well done to Stefan the head chef) - finding somewhere that can Keep the best French Cheeses, cook the best Lobster, and serve the freshest Sushi as well as supplying top quality ingredients in as remote a location as this is quite a feat !  You need the breeze here - so the over-water villas are best for that - also complete absence of mossies and other bugs quite a treat.  We were here for 12 days - and ZERO complaints in all that time (which is pretty unusual for me) !  If you come here (and you should) - book either Half or Full board - as ""pay as you go"" from the menus is eye-wateringly expensive.  Fantastic, friendly service everywhere in the‚Ä¶"
"We are a Six Sense fans, but this was our first time at Six Sense Laamu. It is a beautiful resort, that offers amazing accommodations, heavenly food, but the best of it all are the people working there. Our GEM (guest experience maker) was Alex. She welcomed us in our language (only 2 million people speaks our language, so it is a really big deal!) and made sure we were filling happy with all of our needs fulfilled. For our anniversary we got the best massage I have ever experienced and a surprise chocolate cake, special bed decorations and next to the cake a happy anniversary written in our language! Our favourite staff, who felt more like a friends at the end of our vacation were Bar Manager CJ and his team. An amazing group of people, always welcoming us with a smile and‚Ä¶"
"Spent an amazing week in this hidden gem of Maldives. From start to end you will see nothing but unique and breathtaking. Tons of suprises awaits during the stay. Highly professional staff, first time to experience this kind of service, beyond outstanding! This maybe the best of the best of the travels we had. We started to cry when the crew waving goodbye to us. To sum up, this place is unique and incomparable! Thank you Six Senses laamu!"
From the moment we got off the plane we were made very welcome. The staff through out our staff were excellent and so willing to help in any way the could. The water villa was wonderful with a nice big deck to sit out on  lazing on the day bed.   The food is exceptionally good Michelin starred standard at Leaf. Great food at the Cool bar for lunch or a lighter bite. Free ice cream with so many wonderful flavours to choose from. Breakfast has such a good selection.   The dive center is top notch. Good quality equipment and excellent boat staff who help set up your gear. The dive master do their best to ensure you get to brilliant dive sites. We saw loads of sharks and turtles along with more microscopic fauna .  Thank you we will certainly be back
"Amazing experience at Six Senses Laamu on half board for 7 nights at number 63 water villa on jetty C.  We need to thank a bunch of people for making our stay a fantastic experience:  Bar: CJ and his amazing colleagues thank you for being the reason we went from rating the resort 9 to a full 10 and CJ we would follow you to the end of the world if we knew you would be there once we arrived :-) Truly your standard is beyond high!   Dive centre: Tiana for taking us out on snorkel trips and for being the coolest free diver we ever saw in the water (good luck when you leave Six Senses having been ‚Äúlend out‚Äù, we are sure your presence will be missed when you return to the sister resort) and Valero for giving us our first instruction on diving (your patience cannot be appreciated more‚Ä¶"
We recently come back from our honeymoon in Laamu. It was perfection on all levels.  The decor is laid back and  natural but with an extreme luxe edge. We stayed in an over water villa on jetty C which is the furthest one away. Lots of turtles to see whilst you have your room service breakfast.  The island itself is immaculate and is highly sustainable make sure to do a tour on how it all works really incredible.  The food and the number of restaurants are perfect and of really high quality. Our favourite was leaf. We also did the BBQ on the beach and the sunken table experience. The sunken table experience was the most magical night of our honeymoon. It was very special and completely surpassed our expectations.  Make sure you get your complimentary snorkels at the beginning of‚Ä¶
"We adored everything about Six Senses Laamu and can't think of a single thing that we would want to change about this very special resort. We spent 10 glorious nights here in an over-water villa which had everything that we needed to make our stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible.   We loved the barefoot ethos, our personalised bikes and the rustic, laid-back luxury that epitomises the whole Six Senses Laamu experience. The food and drink on offer was excellent with plenty of choice and we loved getting up early to enjoy the long, leisurely breakfasts on the Indian Ocean - quite a turnaround for someone who is not a morning person! Leaf restaurant was a particular favourite of ours and we appreciated being given what was, in our opinion, the best seat in the house - a‚Ä¶"
"My wife three teenage sons and I have just returned from 10 days at Six Senses Laamu and had an absolutely wonderful experience. The jungle island and surrounding reef are really picture postcard with crystal waters and soft white sand. The accommodation both overwater and beach villa was generously proportioned and very much a luxury Robinson Crusoe feel. The attention to detail, high standards of presentation and professionalism of the staff is most worthy of its 5 star rating.  A very good range of restaurants and would definitely recommend the half board option. Superb choice at breakfast with something for even the most discerning diner.  We completed our Padi diving and the diving sites really are superb as too was the instruction from the Dive School. The resort has an‚Ä¶"
"This was the second time we visited the Six Senses in Lamu and it didn't disappoint. The resort has continued it's excellent service and vision for sustainability. All the staff were very welcoming and it is so nice to get to know your own Gem, who you could trust to handle all your needs and wants.There was never anything that the team could not help you with. The 'bare foot ethos' of the resort adds to the feeling that you are there to connect with nature. We were lucky enough to snorkel alone side turtles, rays and sharks as well as watching the hatching of baby turtles. And not to leave out the amazing fruit bats that entertain you around the swimming pool. An amazing place that we will definitely be visiting again."
"My wife & I stayed in a villa on the island for 5 nights with our 2 children (10 & 6) recently and had the time of our lives.   Everything is next level, from the food to the rooms, the restaurants, the service, the diving, snorkelling and surfing with TropicSurf.   I said to one of my friends after the trip ... just book it. Find 5-10 days and go to the Six Senses Laamu. I can't imagine a person on earth, who wouldn't enjoy their time here.  We had the best time. Planning my next trip soon.  Epic!"
"Perfect paradise to reconnect with nature and disconnect from outside world distractions! This was our 3rd trip to Six Senses Maldives and remains our favorite destination in the world to unwind, relax and ""live in the moment."" From the moment we arrived we felt welcome and pampered, right down to our bare feet for the entire stay! Our Gem, Nadja, took amazing  care of us once again- as did the entire super friendly staff! Can't wait to visit again next year!"
My husband and I spent a week here at Six Senses Laamu in June.  It was our first trip to the Maldives and I am so happy we chose this resort.  Our 8 nights at the resort could not have been more perfect.  We had an overwater villa on Jetty B.  The location was absolutely perfect.  I definitely think the overwater villas are far nicer however if you have a young family a beach villa would be better.  I spent hours every day watching the turtles in our lagoon.  The seem to wake up at 13:55 every day!!! So relaxing.  Everything about the resort was brilliant.  The GM and managers take great care of the resort and are very friendly with their guests.

"Six Senses Laamu is one of the most amazing places to experience. The location, attention to detail, fine dining & service are incredible! There are many amazing activities to choose from & spa treatments are out of this world."
"For sure Six senses Maldives is one of good resort in Maldives... they using lots of natural materials which prefect match with the environment... only problem is : the japanese restaurant , sunset chair ...some area‚Äôs lighting is so bad ... all the ceiling lights directly focusing spot to your face ... very uncomfortable and serious destroyed the ambiance.   The food there genuinely is so so ... only one restaurant ok but the ambiance there is so so..."
"We had wonderful days at Six-Senses Laamu. We swam together with turtles, eagle rays and many colorful fish. The marine biologists stationed on the island explained a lot about life in the ocean, thank you for that. We were also able to observe how the sea turtles hatched. The snorkeling tours organized by our GEM Aslah were impressive. Thank you Aslah, best GEM! Our Ocean Beach Villa with private access to the beach was beautiful, the white sandy beach as well as the turquoise sea invited to stay. The food was good, the ice cream parlor was a hit and the atmosphere in the whole resort was very familiar. It was a feeling of well-being!"
"Six Senses gets you close to the ocean in an extraordinary part of a beautiful country. Under the General Manager's personal direction, the resort has a dedicated team of marine scientists and conservationists working to protect the reefs, seagrasses, mangroves and superb fauna and flora found locally. The resort is a base for BLUE Marine Foundation and is home to the Maldives Underwater Initiative, both of which are campaigning for ocean protection."
"Thanks you so much to Najah (our GEM), Pip (marine biologist), the Dive school, the watersports team, the Spa team, the fitness team, all the bar and restaurant staff, the cleaning team, front of house and management. You all rock!  I recently spent five nights at Six Senses with my wife and two teenage kids. We have never had such a fun, relaxing, luxurious, exciting holiday. This resort has it all. It feels empty even when is full. It is relaxing, with so much to do. It is completely remote and yet has amazing food and wine.  It has a no-shoes policy for guests and staff!  It takes its ecological footprint seriously and is working to conserve the Maldivian marine environment and contribute to the local community.  Tick. Tick. Tick.  Oh, and did I mention the amazing villas and‚Ä¶"
"It was first time to visit Maldives,Six Senses Laamu. We had experienced a lot of activities in the beautiful ocean, for instance,Snorkeling,Diving,Fishing,Surfing... These are impossible to experience in Japan. In addition, all staff are kind and have great hospitality, especially GEM. We really want to come back again in near future."
"We stayed at Six Senses Lamuu during 10 days for our honeymoon.  Everything was perfect and beyond, the place, the localisation, the ocean view villa, the people, the food, the drinks, the snorkeling and so on.  We were lucky enough to assist to 2 turtles hatchlings 2 days in a row thanks to the calls received from our GEM to allow us to assist to this once (twice now!) in a lifetime event.  The food was amazing each night, a little preference for Leaf restaurant and the Mediterranean buffet. Activity-wise, we did paddle board, yoga, massage, snorkeling, eating (a lot!), And relaxing.  We loved the free ice-cream bar and also the movies under the star each night. We also appreciated the sea-ocean related documentary to increase awareness of what is happening around us. It was‚Ä¶"
"Our family of five spent an amazing week with TropicSurf at its Six Senses Laamu branch. Ben and Olena Stokes and their incredible team made sure we all felt welcome and special from the moment we arrived until we reluctantly stepped off the dock to depart. At least 5 surf breaks on offer within 10 minutes boat ride and cater for all levels of surfing ability and the break out front of the surf ‚Äúshack‚Äù (Shoulders) is a great little wave for learners or even better fun for the family to do what Ben has coined ‚Äòthe sunset soft-top challenge‚Äô.  Ben and Olena made sure that everyone was catered for each day with clear communication about what was on offer for the day(s) ahead after taking into account the wind, tide and swell conditions.

"My wife and I spent our honeymoon at Six Senses Laamu and it's the most amazing place we have ever stayed.  We loved everything about it, from our stunning water villa (and the views from that terrace!), to the various fantastic restaurants and bars on offer, to our unforgettable experiences snorkelling and diving around the house reef and beyond (seeing turtles on the house reef and mantas and sharks on excursions with the excellent staff at the dive centre).  We also love the engineering and effort that has gone into making Six Senses Laamu a sustainable facility that makes a positive contribution to the local area. It's a special place that has to be seen to be believed and we'd go back next week if we could!"
"We went there for our wedding anniversary, it was amazing, we arrived really late, and they already prepared our late dinner before we ask, well done.  Our over water Vila was awesome, we just love laying down and just relax in our villa.  Our GEM shaan very proactive, he arrange our need and request very well.  I recommend chill bar for food, bicycling around island, dolphin cruise  and you have to try ice cream station, brilliant idea.  Well done team"
"Wow! wow!Wow! Just got back from an amazing week at Six sense Laamu! was there with my husband for my 40th birthday and what an experience!! Everything was above my expectations...from the time we were met at the airport in Male, the staff was always so polite and professional. They took us to the lounge where we we welcomed with juices and complimentary breakfast...The waiting time was almost none so everything flowed really well. The flight to Laamu was amazing...35 minutes and the most incredible views of the Maldivian Atolls... On arrival we were treated by the staff and once again everyone was gorgeous.

Tried the best restaurant over a herb garden, a very unique dining setting and great food. The most friendly staff we‚Äôve ever seen, name it you will have it! Everyone is so prepared to give a hand. Whole island is designed to full access of beach, sand and jungle. Perfect tie of high end luxury and nature.  We are already thinking of next year visit!"
"Pictures is supposed to speak a thousand words, but the unique experience my wife and I have during our stay between 17/6 - 22/7 is truly beyond what you can see on pictures.    Six Senses Laamu is located on an island that has its own house reef.  The lagoon is as calming as an inland lake on a good day (this in itself is already an attraction), and it would be a short 15 mins ride to get to the resort.    This is my second time in the Maldives and Six Senses Laamu do really stands out in these few ways: - Location: despite a 35mins domestic flight away its remoteness means you get a natural and unspoiled environment.   -  Ecology: you can see every effort the team here bring what the Six Senses brand means into life, and you can see their passion exercising this.  This helps‚Ä¶"
"One of our best trip that we‚Äôve experienced. The staff members are thoughtful and nice. The villas are very private with own pool. We will definitely come back in the future. The only thing that needs to be improved is the food as we come from Hong Kong, the quality is not to up to the standards compares to the food in a five stars hotel in Hong Kong."
"Excellent resort with an amazing way of sustainable living. Beautiful marine lives (and a TEAM of marine biologists!), delicate organic food, natural yet luxurious rooms, and most importantly, super great people, both staff and guests. Truly happy and thankful for having stayed here!"
"I‚Äôve been to 26 countries, had a lot of vacations, but this trip to six senses Laamu was the most amazing experience I‚Äôve ever had. Everything was super nice, stuff, food, cleanliness   Thanks for the whole team from my heart "
"This is very great resort, ppl.waves.foods are so nice and pretty, we don‚Äôt wanna go back ‚Ä¶ hope to come here ASAP, and also Emma is perfect, help us a lot , we will visit here again for sure. Thank you"
"From the moment you step foot on the island you feel like you are home.  You can tell that the staff genuinely enjoy working there, the food is beautiful (and well priced compared to other islands) and the lead in room category; which I was in; was well appointed and spacious.  They live and breathe sustainable living which for me was what drew me to their Resort."
"This place is simply amazing! The scenery is to die for, the food is extraordinary and the service is that if what a King would receive.. My wife and I traveled here from Florida and it was worth every minute of our 26 hour trip here. "
"It‚Äôs beyond words to describe how great is six senses Laamu. Their service, their staffs are just excellent! Six Senses Laamu think about everything they could to make their guest feel comfortable throughout their stay. The smile from everyone that we met during our stay just made our day!! We felt that we were back to the nature. No shoes was needed, bicycle was our transport through our stay. So love the idea!! We would love to come back again and have a longer stay!! Highly recommend the resort to anyone who plan to go Maldives!!"
"For our honeymoon, we knew we had wanted to stay in an overwater villa in the Maldives. We had so many options to choose from and it got a bit overwhelming so I leveraged our American Express Travel concierge service (I HIGHLY recommend this to any AmEx users out there) who narrowed down a few options for us to choose from based on our requirements and preferences.  From the moment we read through the reviews and researched Six Senses Laamu, we knew that this was the place we wanted to go - and it did NOT disappoint. As soon as we arrived, we met our GEM (Guest Experience Manager) who gave us a quick tour and allowed us some time to settle in. Ali (our GEM) was attentive, professional and always there when we needed anything! He was the best!  We stayed in an overwater Villa‚Ä¶"
"From the moment you arrive you sense the expanse of the resort and as well as its slightly raw, low key yet evident luxury and you feel you are breathing more easily. The mind stills and being in the moment begins.  The exceptional staff seem to think ahead for you and every detail or need to fulfilled without question and with a graciousness that implies they are simply here to make your stay whatever you desire. They are not intrusive in any way but they do still manage to offer that perfect balance of checking details regularly, asking new questions and then if necessary organizing any request without any fuss.  Nothing is forgotten and you simply feel you are their only guest.  As a Six Senses property the attention to detail, room fittings, amenities, restaurant choices and‚Ä¶"
"I planned this trip away for my 40th birthday and enjoyed every moment!  Upon arriving you are assigned a GEM (guest experience manager) ours was Abdullah and he went above and beyond to make sure we wanted for nothing.   One thing we liked was the no shoe policy on the island, it is not compulsory but we were more than happy to follow suit.   We went half board and found this to be perfectly adequate. Walking down in the mornings you will be greeted by an amazing array of food and drink, enough for even the most hardcore foodie.  The choice of restaurants were great, we especially enjoyed the chill bar. On a couple of nights there was a buffet which we enjoyed immensely!   Each person is allocated a bicycle which we found nice however we elected to make most of the scenery by‚Ä¶"
"Went here for my partners 40th and loved it. Am not usually one to sit back and relax but now highly recommend it. It is a long way but is definitely worth it.   We went half board and didn‚Äôt need any more food so wouldn‚Äôt recommend full board. Drinks were expensive and paying for water outside of the room is a little daft given it is free when in the villa. You High costs are expected I guess when you are so far away from everything but they did seem a little excessive. Despite this slight frustration we had the most amazing time.  We lounged around most days, wandering down to the most incredible breakfast selection first thing, taking a leisurely stroll back to the villa before sitting out, swimming and snorkelling. Mid afternoon we usually took a nap or went to Sip Sip or‚Ä¶"
"Although we  have traveled a lot I think that this has been the trip of our life.We have been 8 days at the Six Senses Laamu and the experience has been wonderful.The philosophy of the six senses of unite sustainability, ecology and luxury has been achieved to perfection. The hotel is integrated into nature. the slogan ‚Äúno news and no shoes‚Äù allows you to relax 100%, From the first moment to the last you feel special, the treatment is always personalized. Our GEM ( guest experience maker), Auzan, has been always pending  of us, he is there when you need, he has tried to make each day special, he has proposed restaurants and activities without imposing anything; always cordial and attentive. All equip is excelent, We recommend the experience and at least once go to Sex Senses‚Ä¶"
"Beautiful sea, soft beds, romantic atmosphere Suitable for many couples The food is delicious, everything, the massage at the spa is relaxing, all the staff are truly willing to serve and most importantly, the delicious ice cream 42 flavors are free all day."
"My wife and I recently returned from a 13 night stay at Six Sense Laamu in the Maldives. We stayed in  an over-the-water bungalow with its own private pool at the end of jetty A (sunrise side). We absolutely loved our room, loved our outdoor shower, and loved our view. Our room was very comfortable, private, and cozy. We wanted to stay there forever.       Our Guest Experience Manager(GEM) was Abdullah, a very friendly Maldivian gentleman who functioned as a proactive concierge and then some. He was our go to guy. If we had a question he could answer it. If we had a problem he could solve it. If we had a need he could fulfill. For example, my wife‚Äôs hair straightener failed on our very first day (my fault btw). A day and a half latter, Abdullah presented us with a new one that‚Ä¶"
"I'm so glad that we made the decision to visit Six Senses Laamu for our honeymoon. It was indeed a paradise. Extraordinary natural environment and amazingly friendly crews provided the best experience you can ever imagine for a Maldives honeymoon. The ocean view, beach, room, foods, and SPA...everything was just perfect and we have created so many precious memories. (I was worried about the mosquitoes but it turns out that I haven't seen any mosquito during my stay. Not even one!)  We spent half of our stay in beach villa and another half in ocean villa. Both rooms are excellent. Although Maldives resorts are famous for ocean villas, beach villa actually has a more spacious bathroom and balcony, and it has more privacy than ocean villa. We enjoyed beautiful sunrise view from our‚Ä¶"
"We will never forget everything we live in the Maldives, in this exceptional hotel. Our favorite place in the world. Thanks to everyone in Six Senses Laamu. We‚Äôre looking forward to coming back soon!!"
"We truly loved our stay at SS Laamu. The staff is very friendly and trying hard to make your stay memorable. They showed a great team spirit, hospitality and compassion. Food is great, and thanks to all chefs for being patient and creative with our requests. Our lovely GEM Mila ‚ù§Ô∏è was super efficient, patient, kind, sweet helped so much during the trip!

"So... for years I've been wanting to travel to Maldives. Just like most travelers.. is on the bucket list! Thanks to a wonderful dear friend, she recommended Six Senses Laamu. One key decision factor for us was their corporate value on sustainability. Geographically, Australia is a long way to depart from to Six Senses Laamu! So for our 5th year wedding anniversary and our birthdays.. we booked the trip. Over water bungalow with 5 restaurants on the island - we were spoil for choice. We spent 7 days on the island and it was amazing. A few things really stood out for us and if they are of importance to you as well then this is definitely the place for you. 1) World class personable service from the day you arrive and in all areas of the island. A lot of places claim they do that‚Ä¶"
"We spent 6 days at Six Senses Laamu atoll during second week May 2019. It was low season, just the beginning, and rain season was starting. We had 2 days raining, but 20 minutes each day and,....with a 30 Celsius degrees temperature and 90% humidity, welcome rain! Weather is hot, because termic sensation is higher than real temperature. Please, do not forget much sun cream, total protection, 50 block factor! Six Senses and his staff is perfect! Very nice and always looking after you to make your stay a lifetime memory! The food is spicy but never had a digestion problem. Quality food, fresh ingredients and God‚Äôs cooks, perfect combination to discover local and international cuisine. Ladies, your husbands will be very happy to pack only a pair of shoes in your baggage! There is a‚Ä¶"
"We spent 5 nights at Six Senses Laamu. From the beginning to the end, Everything is excellent.  Special thanks to Ashlah/Our dedicated GEM and Tarn/Thai Chef. They made our holiday so special.  Paradise on earth!"
"We visited Six Senses Laamu earlier this year and it did not disappoint. We have now had a few trips to this wonderful island and every time it just seems to get better and better. I remember the first time we came many years ago and we were worried that the extra internal flight was going to be a pain... trust me it's BEYOND worth getting away from some of the busier parts the Maldives to the haven that is Laamu. No boats going by, no planes over head just beautiful ocean for miles and miles. Everything about this place is perfection - from the rooms (we love the ocean villas) to the food (the breakfast buffet is unreal) and from the staff (we LOVE our GEM Abdullah and the GM Marteyne always takes the most wonderful care of us) to the facilities (we learnt to surf on our most‚Ä¶"
"My review will repeat much of what has already been said, I cannot fault Six Senses Laamu - We spent 11 days in an overwater villa (37) on Jetty B; this was a great location as the waters were calmest between the A & B and the snorkelling was good, we saw rays and turtles on a regular basis.  The service is the best I have seen at a resort with an extremely high staff to guest ratio (2-1 much of the time) and they all try their hardest to ensure you are happy.  Given that 51% of staff come from the local Maldivan community, they show real pride in all their work.  Our GEM, Abdullah, in particular went out of his way to make sure we were happy as did all of the other staff, especially those at breakfast and in Chill & Sip Sip (Yameen and Madukar get a special shout).  We traveled‚Ä¶"
"We visited Six Senses Laamu as a group of 8 people (7 adults & 1 infant) and stayed in 3 ocean water villas. Everything is perfect. The location, resort, villas are all beautiful and their staffs are very attentive. Especially, our GEM (Guest Experience Maker) is very helpful in every aspect. Six Senses staffs were escorting us since we arrived in Male and took care of everything for us.  We bought the half-board meal option which we think it's enough for us since we are not morning people. We always finish our breakfast quite late so it's just about fine without lunch option. For Asian people, I recommend Chill Bar (Vietnamese restaurant) and Zen (Japanese restaurant) for dinner.  The facilities in the resort are also great. There's a lot of complimentary facilities you can use‚Ä¶"
"Had a fabulous 5 day stay at 2 different villas. This is my third six senses resort and the best by far. Big thanks to our GEM (Guest Experience Maker) Aslah for taking care of us and making the trip special. Over water pool villa was amazing with nice view, good privacy and easy access to the ocean for snorkeling. The beach front villa also has a stunning view from the room but less privacy where anyone could walk right in front of the villa. I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way because the view is amazing and the sound of wave at night is less intimidating.   Great property, variety of activities available, friendly service, great food, beautiful ocean and corals, what more could we ask for? The only thing that fell short is the Japanese restaurant that could use some improvement."
"My friend and I visited the resort in March. We were very impressed by the massages we had - it was a real pity I didn't get the names of the masseuses, as they do deserve praise.... We tried several - Thai, deep tissue and Abhyanga. While the Abhyanga was OK, the other two were way beyond our expectation. Highly recommend them! But, the same cannot be said for our dining experience... We had to wait for what seemed like ages to be served. I should add that the food was very tasty, but the waiting time really spoiled our evening."
"Well what a resort. My wife and I have been very lucky to be able to visit some beautiful hotels and restaurants around the world but were still left in awe during our 10 day stay at Six Senses Laamu. The hotel / resort is absolutely beautiful. The service from all of the staff is extemporary and then we get to the food. Simply divine -  every single meal in every restaurant. Leaf is outstanding and the other 3 just as good. On a par with many a 'starred' restaurant and this is for every meal. The management are clearly fabulous as the attention to detail from all the staff is outstanding. A special extra mention to Jerry, Warren and Alsah - thank you for being amazing. We can not recommend this resort highly enough - it is a Must Visit. We will most certainly return."
"Ok, so the journey to get there was - even flying from Colombo - quite a drama. Delays, lack of communication at the Male domestic airport and very, very hot temperatures did make us quite grumpy. So grumpy, my husband said 'they really have to deliver something very special at Six Senses to make up for this.'  And well, as soon as we got onto the boat, drink in our one hand while we used our other hand to take off our shoes and put them away, we forgot about the journey. Water splashing, the wind in our hair and there, in the distance, the overwatervilla's of Six Senses Laamu. Paradise is here.  Upon arrival we were greeted by a lot of the staff, ready to take us on a little tour around the resort. Resort is actually a word I dont like to use for this place. Resort sounds so‚Ä¶"
"Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. The food in all the restaurants was first class and you was only spoilt for choice. The trips were always exciting and filled with anticipation. I myself enjoyed  The talks and stargazing by Dr Parag, a fascinating subject of which we know so little about! The traditional hand line fishing was also a highlight of mine apart from the fact the wife caught more than me (lucky). The villas, What can you say. making you feel like you‚Äôre on your own island with private sea with all the underwater fish you could ever wish to see. The whole villa experience is one of being in touch with nature and making a minimal impact. Special thanks to Aslah our rep that was always on hand to organise anything we requested. From 2 happy people Steve &‚Ä¶"
"This was our second visit to Laamu in as many years and it is in our view heaven on earth. With a strong leaning towards luxury eco-tourism, conservation and wellness, the facilities, care and attention and overall ambience are out of this world. Laamu has a much more 'island/barefoot' feel than many of the other islands, which makes it far superior to us. The food is brilliant too (thank you to all the staff at Leaf for a wonderful Sri Lankan banquet and those in the other restaurants feeding my Mashuni addiction!).  Both my son and I loved the diving, and many thanks to all, especially Dani!  My son also really enjoyed the surfing (thanks Francois) and we all had a great time in the Spa (especially my wife, who I believe might now even be receiving post there!!! :)  ).   A‚Ä¶"
"My husband and I have just come back from the best week ever at Six Senses Laamu. From start to finish the whole week was perfect. Our GEM Ravah was so incredible and organised everything we needed. The service is perfect, setting is beautiful and the over water villa was the best hotel room that we have ever stayed in. The management were also so friendly and they made our stay so relaxing. Thank you so much team Laamu! Camilla and Henry :)"
"We (family of 4 with boys 9&11) have just come back from 9 days in the Six Senses in Laamu and I can only highly recommend you go. It was one of the most ‚Äûround‚Äú experiences we had and we have stayed in many very nice hotels over the years. We initially hesitated due to the longer travel time but they more than made up for this. You are taken care of from the time you land in male to when you take off again. Transfers were all well organised and ran smoothly. When you arrive at the island this is when you guest experience manager takes over. In our case Shifu not only had made reservations in restaurants in advance but also has made sure we are always up to date on what‚Äôs going on on the island so we didn‚Äôt miss anything. She also took care of some minor issues in the villa, one‚Ä¶"
"We‚Äôve been fortunate to visit some terrific hotels and Laamu already has so many amazing reviews. So for something a little different, and as we wait for our flight home, we asked our 12 year old daughter for her highlights.  1 Super surfing. The instructors were great and taught us all sorts of tricks. I improved so much! 2 Turtle rescue. We were just finishing our snorkel trip when the boat captain jumped in to the sea with his clothes on! He‚Äôd spotted a turtle that was tangled in an old fishing net. The marine biologist cut the net away and set the turtle free. A good day! 3 Wow water villas. We saw big fish, rays and turtles swim past nearly every day.  4 Fantastic freedom. It was brilliant being able to cycle around the island on my own and with my friends. I can‚Äôt do this‚Ä¶"
"We three, my husband, our daughter and I have just got back from Six Senses Laamu. We intended to have a relaxing vacation. And we experienced even better that we had expected.  Once we stepped in the resort, we didn‚Äôt wear any shoes for the whole trip. (Of course, except when we used fins in the water.)  The pathways were well taken care for everyone to walk bare zv. The bicycles‚Äô paddles were wrapped with the fabric so we could ride our bicycles comfortably. We felt unbelievably comfort without shoes.  We could wear as casual as we wanted even whem we had a nice dinner in their restaurants. No dress code.   Our GEM was Mr. AuZam. He took very good care of us. He arranged whatever we would like to have and to do. He gave us some advice where to snorkel and get the best scene.‚Ä¶"
"We stayed in September for 7 nights in a lagoon view villa and this was our first time in the Maldives. Our expectations were high before we arrived but we were absolutely amazed by the experience this resort gave us. It is hard to think of anything negative to say about this place. The facilities offer everything you would want during your stay, the staff were friendly and helpful and food was amazing. The whole resort was clean and well kept and had such a wonderful relaxing atmosphere. It never felt busy or crowded at any stage yet there was plenty of activities on offer for those who wanted them. Our room was huge and had everything we needed. We loved the deck area which had amazing views yet was still protected from the neighboring villas. Having direct access to the water‚Ä¶"
"This was my second time back at Six Senses Laamu, my first trip was as a solo traveller. The resort is located in the Laamu Atoll which is about a 45minutes flight from Male and this seclusion comes with pristine beautiful waters and dreamlike underwater diving experience (if you are into scuba diving). All of our needs were met and personalized by our GEM (Guest Experience Maker) Shiifu; each room is assigned a GEM. Personally, the resort is an excellent choice for anyone who seeks a luxurious holiday complemented by wellness.  If you are an existing diver or potentially interested, their new dive centre Deep Blue Divers is exceptional in terms of quality of service and dive sites destination in Maldives. The team is extremely friendly and of course knowledgable, it felt like I‚Ä¶"
"Following our friends' recommendation who have been to this resort seven times, we were happy to find an amazing package deal. The resort is lovely! Everything easy to book and nearby: surfing, wind/kite surfing, diving, snorkeling, kayaks. In addition, we really liked the ""back of the house trip"" to learn about the strategies to become plastic-free, how faded towels are not thrown away and turned into flower pots, how broken glass is transformed back to sand and much more. This is a little universe on its own, a bit like the LOST TV show...Our kids loved the free range chicken spot with freshly borns. The food offers were great albeit we missed more Sri Lankan/Indian options for dinner. Hotel guests are all relaxed and literally everyone loved the ""barefoot luxury"" - that's‚Ä¶"
"Perfection from arrival till departure. Could not have asked for better. Everything  from the location, the hotel itself, the staff, the food, the spa, and activities - all 10/10.  Would book again without hesitation."
"Wishing to have a dream week in the paradise? Go to Six Senses Laamu. Amazing location, great hotel facilities, exquisite food and one of the best services I‚Äôve ever tried. All taken care in every detail to personalize the guests experience. Aashla our GEM (Guest Experience Maker) was the best - being there for us and taking care of all we needed and wished. Certainly recommended! Tks!!!"

"I travelled with my large family (4 kids ages of 5,8, 12 and 14 + parent + sister). In total we were 9 staying in 3 Ocean Villas. The hotel is a 10/10 in many ways. The island is equiped with everything you need: amazing scuba center, incredible Surf School, all Water sports you could imagine, Cinema, and incredible gym, and outstanding Spa, 5 restaurants, a free ice-cream bar (with 42 flavours open 10 hours a day). I never write reviews and this time I decided that both the hotel and the staff deserve it. There are so many amenities, so many details and so much love the team puts in making your stay unforgetable that it is very difficult not to be super positive.  The GEMs (Guest Experience Managers) are really super helpful, always there, super attentive and super smiley. They‚Ä¶"
"Amazing service. All the staff is looking after you constantly and having a GEM has been extremely helpful for our stay.   The food is really good. The Chill bar is excellent, we have almost tried all the menu and everything was incredible. The beakfast is very diverse, you have many options to choose.   The rooms are very complete. We stayed in the Beach Villa the first night and then we moved to the Water Villa for the rest of the stay and both were perfectly clean and extremely beautiful. Anything a guest can need is in the room.   In conclusion, we had an excellent experience in Six Senses. We loved it and we hope we could comeback soon.   Thank you to all the staff to make possible a such amazing stay."
"One of our most memorable trips. We picked Six Senses for our honeymoon. And I am so happy we decided to stay here. Can‚Äôt say enough great things about it...the morning breakfast is amazing, the villas are beautiful and private (outdoor shower, deck, glass tub), the service is excellent, and location is unbelievable. Never ever will I see water like this again. We stayed here for a week and had a hard time leaving. If we went back, we would stay here again and have recommended it to all of our friends and family.   During our stay, we had used the safe to keep our jewelry secure.

"Wowwwww!!! I don‚Äôt think I have been to a place like this before in my life! I thought  we were going to a very cool hotel but never expected to find such an amazing place! Everything from start to end was absolutely perfect. Sustainability is at the heart of everything they do and you realise this quickly after you arrive. We had an incredible time. My kids absolutely loved the kids club, Jovi was amazing and my kids quickly fell in love with her. Ravah our Gem was great as well and did everything for us to have an amazing stay.

I met so many nice people there that I felt really sad when I left... thinking that maybe I would never seen them again, believe it or not I cried when I was waving‚Ä¶"
We stayed in the hotel because our original hotel had a small fire so we were transferred to Six Senses a few weeks before we arrived. What a great bit of good fortune for us because this was the best place we have ever stayed and we travel a lot. We took off our shoes on the boat from the airport and never wore shoes for a week. That may sound simple but it was so liberating. We both wanted somewhere to switch off totally and this was the place. We had a great...no a fabulous GEM (Guest Experience Manager) in Kokko. We truly felt special and we would go back in a minute. Not only was the resort a great place to go and see what is the marvel of the Maldives but it was totally in touch with sustainability...only leave your footprints...was the mantra that stuck in our heads.

So much to do, free ice creams and just paradise! All the staff are so friendly, knowledgable and helpful! Also a bit shout out to Leevan!   Can we come back and live there?!"
Imagine a dream trip. I know were you should go! You should go to six senses Laamu in the Maldives. These are reasons to go there. Firstly you get a bike that you can ride. Secondly there is a kids club with wonderful activities for kids if you have them. You can go snorkeling too in the coral reef. Finally there is a beautiful beach with clean water. To sum up this hotel is fantastic and if you have not stayed at six senses Laamu I highly recommend it for you.
"We have just returned from a week at Six Senses in Laamu. It is a wonderful property in a stunning place, surrounded by an abundance of animal life. This was our first trip to the Maldives and we had some reservations about bringing the kids (aged 3 and 6) for fear that there wouldn't be enough to do with them, the resort may not cater for kids of this age and that generally the facilities wouldn't be set up for them. Well we certainly needn't have worried. The staff, food, facilities and everything else was perfect for us. The kids club was amazing and a special mention goes to the ladies working there who really made every effort to have activities that appealed to all of the kids. It was really well organised and professionally run by a great team. The kids also loved the‚Ä¶"

"Incredible experience, excellent staff and service. It was an absolute dream. The food in each restaurant was delicious and the quality was really high. We felt alone in the island even though the resort was almost at full capacity. Would for sure go back whenever I have the chance."
"To get there: a small domestic flight 40min then a speedboat ride of 20min. Correspondence around 4h waiting time in Male for both + an hour waiting from Kadhdhoo on the return flight They don‚Äôt even have their own lounge, so you need to wait in a really miserable lounge all these hours.  Room: Paid USD 3,000 for an Ocean Water villa with pool and all the villas from the opposite jetty could see us. Bathroom is only outdoor.  Room inside is really small. Be careful the size mentioned on the website 126sqm takes into account the whole area inside and outside (terrace, pool, bathroom etc.). Inside is not bigger than 40sqm. Looking for a bit more privacy go for Laamu (even though total privacy cannot be achieved in this resort) Bed is really short even my girlfriend's feet were out‚Ä¶"
"Very elegant room on the turquoise blue see. Excellent service. Lots of activities including diving. Some of the most amazing diving sites I have experienced in 20 years. The diving team is particularly excellent. From the manager to the boat guys all true professionals. Best I have seen. Everything runs in a very smooth, safe and enjoyable way. Also Tropical surf runs a great shop there. Perfect for beginners and advanced surfers. 100% recommend it"
"Everything was just perfect. Staff extremely professional and friendly. Nice and very good restaurants, one better than the other one with amazing views. Beautiful beaches, nice snorkeling. As for the accomodation we can only recommend the Laamu Water Villas. Thanks to our GEM Asla and the entire staff we had an unforgettable stay and relaxed vacation.  We ejoyed every minute and can only recommend the Six Senses Laamu. Hope to be back soon. Nadine and Christian"
"Everything was amazing. From the time we arrived till the very last moment of departure (where all the team and even the General Manager (!) came to wave us goodbye) we were taken great care of.  The smallest detail was well thought about and our wishes came true only by thinking about them. Our GEM Najah was so polite, discrete and experienced and made our stay an unforgettable one. The sea villas are excellent and to the finest quality. The same goes for all the facilities. However I believe the strength of this resort is the mentality and positive attitude of all the employees there. Every employee we discussed with was talking highly of the management team and this says a lot.  The restaurant team was the most polite team I have ever met. They were always surprising us with‚Ä¶"

What an amazing place! Visited March 2019 for our 1 year anniversary. Stayed in a lammu water villa with pool - definitely worth the extra $$. Entire staff was wonderful! Service and food quality outstanding! Everything about this place is perfect! We have stayed in many wonderful spots around the world and this place tops the list! The sandbank dinner experience (although expensive) worth it - a truly memorable experience! Highly recommend Six Senses and planning to visit again!
"When booking our stay at Laamu I was initially a little worried about having to take a second flight from Male. But it couldn‚Äôt have been more straightforward to get there. Lovely representatives meet you and make it so easy for you. In no time at all, you are on the boat to Laamu. And once you are there it is absolutely 150% worth it - there are no planes overhead, no big boats going past... just the vastness of the beautiful blue sea and sky all to yourself... Safe to say, it is incredibly peaceful. Everyone you meet that works at the hotel is wonderful. So friendly and helpful. The food is delicious with so many different restaurants to choose from. The diving and marine conservation guys are great and the underwater life is AMAZING. The spa is beautiful and the treatment I‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses Laamu is our choice destination for a holiday, whether as a couple or with our now grown children - we have been 6 times since it opened, and Marteyn van Well, General Manager, continues to deliver on what is for us the best destination anywhere for a relaxing ocean holiday.  The setting is just spectacular - from our water villa in Jetty A we could see eagle ray and turtles passing by and under us, while snorkelling right off the villa rewards you with exceptional scenes of beauty at the drop-off.  To top it all off we swam with manta rays. The marine biology and dive centre have a great and committed team, incomparable in breadth and scope to any we have seen anywhere, and while we don't scuba dive, friends of ours who do and have stayed at SSL swear by it.  Food‚Ä¶"
"We stayed at Six Senses at the end of Feb 2019.   Right from the first greeting at the airport, we knew this was a special place. Six Senses has an unfair advantage being set in what can only be described as near-paradise perfection in terms of location and surroundings.  The colour of the sky and water al,OST makes you faint. The standard of the care, attention to detail, accommodation and catering is outstanding.  Nothing is too much trouble for the staff, everything is thought about on your behalf. My particular highlight was the diving which is simply jaw-dropping.  The mega-fauna you are privileged to see in such abundance is remarkable.  It is hard to describe get overall impact of the experience, other than it was amazing.  We will be back.  If you can, go.  An experience‚Ä¶"
"This review is long overdue.   My wife and I had our honeymoon at Six Senses Laamu. I wish I had my notes but am sure the GM can look me up and find who helped us during our stay.   This place is simply magical. The staff is incredible. The food truly delicious. Most importantly, this resort is eco-friendly and self-sustainable.  We are planning to return soon and make the 30+ hour trip to this remote island.   Don't think twice. Visit this place. It is exclusive and a hidden gem."
"Six Senses went above and beyond to make our trip truly special. The island and resort is beautiful and the staff are super friendly.  Our water villa had super views and the interiors were great. We loved using our own bicycles as a mode of transport around the island.   Our Guest Experience Manager Aslah made every effort to make our holiday as exciting and special as he could, this was much appreciated. All the GEMs build a good rapor with their guests and this was evident throughout our stay.   We were particularly impressed by the quality of the food and wide range of choice available within the restaurants. The Leaf restaurant was our favourite and the design of the restaurant is very impressive.   The marine life is super special at Six Senses with the House Reef right on‚Ä¶"
"We have traveled the world and no where have we experience such personal & professional care. Koko was our ‚ÄúGEM‚Äù and from the time we arrived made our stay fun and relaxing. We commend the level of understanding and professionalism throughout all of our experiences. Steven our dive coach was all A+++, he was patient and reassuring in all of our dive experiences. Keep up the great work!!We will definitely return!"
"We have never ever been a place this beautiful, never ever before met so many nice people, smiling, helpful, caring. (And we have been many places!)   The villa always clean and nice.  Our gem Najah took so good care of us, everything was arranged, ready and restaurants booked. All we had to do was lean back and relax. Just perfect. What really make this place unique is the staff!! They are extremely freindly, making a wonderful atmosphere. The restaurants are sublime! CJ and his team wonderful! Also the excursion to local island, snorkling and picnic on the most beautiful bounty island (Hanhushi) was amazing! We had some treatments in the spa. Also the best! Had some new great experiences in singing bowls with Muayad and watsu with Banu and super nice yoga with Kunchok. A‚Ä¶"
"Wonderful location, the villa where we stayed was  spacious and nice, the service was perfect. The SPA experiences we had were unforgettable , professional therapist( Chem) The food was delicious. We could join a lot of activities. It was nothing what we missed. We will come back!!!"
"We are back from our fifth visit to this fabulous island , truly heaven .Marteyne the general manager looked after us so well , and you know she herself just loves this Island .Our gem Auzam was on hand to organise what ever we wanted and to keep us informed of what was happening each day .The food is fabulous where ever you eat on the island , the breakfast is a feast and the almond croissants are amazing üòÉ.The fun of cycling around the island or walking round barefooted is great .The diving is fabulous with amazing and patience dive masters nothing is to much trouble , fabulous coral and turtles always a favourite .Great music from the DJ as you chill out with a drink .Sit under the stars watching a movie , heaven unspoilt island .Cant wait to return"
"An absolutely breathtaking and astonishing accommodation. We came here to relax and unwind and to leave the busy life behind for the time. The service of the hotel, the accommodation itself, the wonderful and delightful diners, the picnic on a deserted island and the stunning views. It was like everything we hoped for and more!"
"Just returned home from our fifth visit to Laamu and it just gets better. We always feel very welcome and we are looked after so very well. \many thanks to Marteyne, Auzam, Assif and the whole team. The Dive team are amazing and fun people from all over the world. The Marine team work so hard and are so informative that they make learning how we can look after our oceans seem like fun.  We did the ""backstage tour"" this year and learned how it all works. It is incredible how much the team do for growth, recycling and de-salination. Nothing goes to waste and they are constantly looking at new innovative ideas.  We have visited many of the islands in the Maldives and they are all good but Laamu outshines them all. The food the people the atmosphere the villas everything is just‚Ä¶"
"Overheating 6 sensens is what Six Senses Laamu does!! One of our best experiences in Resort-experience.  6 stars for each sense they touch! Our personal Gem, the accommodation, the villa, the underwater world, the private diners, the authentic friendliness of the staff, the great cooking: they all exceed the highest level. Congrats!!! Roel & Francisca Van de Wiele - Antwerp - Belgium"
"We spent again 1 week at Six Senses Laamu. It was a wonderful week with perfect service on all levels and in all areas (special thanks to Ali our Gem!j, excellent food also in all restaurants (this time we liked The Leave Restaurant the most). The villas are still very well maintained and we loved the combination of Laamu Water Pool Villa and Ocean Beach Pool Villa. We can highly recommend this resort and would love to come back. Thanks to everybody who took care of us!"
"This is a top resort in the Maldives where the service is of the highest standard. Our accommodation, a beach villa with pool was lovely. However is very expensive! Some dinners cost $175 ex drink to which service and tax are added, another 22%. If on a half board basis the allowance is $80 per head so it doesn‚Äôt really go anywhere. Having opted for half board we left with a large bill which rather took the edge off the holiday."
"Some personal impressions from my stay at Six Sense Laamu Maldives with some of my good friends. In total it is my 48th trip to Maldives in the last 20 years......the most distanced hotel from Male Airport I ever experienced which we knew before. Starting with the bad news: after a 12 hours trip from Europe, arriving Male International, you need another 4,5 hours to finally arrive the island including another local flight (50 min) and an additional speed boat trip (25 min)...finally and additional check in procedure....... not worth to do it for a trip shorter than 8 days! (If I going to Baros and traveling with hand luggage only I am in my room 45 min. after touch down at Male International)! We tried to address some comments to the GM Martyne during the weekly sundown‚Ä¶"
"From the moment you set foot on the boat towards the resort you feel that peace and calmness coming to you. The cold towel and the bottled water with a scent of the Six Senses signature lemongrass is just an amazing feeling. You instantly remember why you decided to chose Six Senses Resorts again.   Arriving the resort is just magical.  Your GEM escorts you to your Villa and ensures you that what ever it is that you might need they will take care of it. The peace and calmness you feel is worth every penny spent on the trip. No check in process, no credit cards, no nothing. Just relax, relax and relax.   Out of the four Six Senses resorts we‚Äôve been to, Laamu is my number 1. The location is just beyond beautiful. All staff you interact with have a genuine peaceful and caring‚Ä¶"
"Quite simply the most perfect place to spend our honeymoon. It is paradise and worth the distance.  The staff were exceptional (we loved our GEM Ally), you feel at home but in five star luxury.  The barefoot culture is fabulous and everything is breathtakingly beautiful.  The food and dining is superb and many activities such as kite surfing, diving and surfing kept us joyously entertained.  We miss it already!"
"We spend 4 days in Laamu from Six Senses and we made the most of it. If you are looking for a place where wellness, excellent food and paradisiac landscapes, you might fall in Love with the Laamu!  Our stay was perfect on all aspects, mainly thanks to their quality of service and the staff.   They immediately make you feel at home and relaxed since they encourage their guests to walk around barefoot on the island. Meaning, no one has to bother with any kind of heels or flip flops. Just go to the restaurant in your simplest  shoes :) Both water and beach villas offer great view on the blue sea and don‚Äôt miss the snorkelling, you will have a blast.  They offer a wide range of activities during your stay, you won‚Äôt have the time to bother.  We liked very much the Sustainable tour‚Ä¶"
"A unique location. The resort is currently the only one in Laamu atoll, so get there soon! Six Senses attention to detail is particularly evident in the villas ( large, spacious and thoughtful touches everywhere). You can see the sea from almost everywhere in this gorgeous resort, the spa is fabulous and gym goers are well catered for with daily classes from aerial yoga to core training! The Leaf restaurant serves consistently amazing dishes every evening and service across the resort is of the highest standard, as you would expect from Six Senses. The daily wellbeing drink at breakfast is truly worth sampling and Ravah our GEM ( there to help you arrange everything you need on a daily basis) was genuine and helpful. Nothing is too much trouble! Well worth a visit, the marine‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses is the perfect place to unwind and recharge your batteries.... from the moment you arrive nothing is too much trouble.    A heavenly beach awaits, with a house reef just off the Chill Bar for snorkelling..... turtles shark rays and shoals of fish just going about their lives.  A selection of restaurants is available from the top Leaf to Zen (Japanese) to Latitude depending on your feeling and that‚Äôs not to mention the wonderful ice cream parlour with fifty plus flavours - all home made! A bike for getting about on helps you feel you are taking some exercise if you can‚Äôt face the gym or yoga classes! We are definitely going back again"
"Be prepared to cry upon leaving SSL, apart from that there no negative points. Breathtaking blue of the Indian Ocean, lush vegetation in the island, the softest white sand in the shallow beach were our 7 year-old son spent entire hours, excellent conditions and facilities for snorkeling, diving and surfing, abundant underwater sea life, sunset dolphin cruise, amazing spa, extremely courteous and smiling staff, the relaxed atmosphere among the other guests the most of whom are the European families - I can go on and on but to put it shortly from now on we do not imagine celebrating our wedding anniversary anywhere else. The return to the everyday life has never been harsher. You deliver, guys!"
"If you really want to escape and pull all the wires out, this is the place to go. Your host, (GEM) will ensure your stay is filled with memorable moments, beach BBQs, fishing trips, dolphins, excellent wines (beware, wine is expensive in The Maldives). On this, our 2nd visit we particularly enjoyed the fab spa, picnic on an uninhabited island and deep sea fishing. Our catch was served to us in the evening in a specially prepared menu by the awesome head chef, Stefan. A never to-be-forgotten meal! Praise to the entire team for a totally amazing holiday. "
"Everything about this place is incredible. The setting, the food, the service, the wildlife and the staff who are so passionate about what they do and so friendly. Special mention to Shifu, our brilliant GEM who looked after us so well and also to CJ and his bar team. We'd highly recommend the dolphin cruise - unforgettable experience and we had a private cinema under the stars which was great! We had a really fun afternoon doing 'Battle of the Bartenders' with Jerry and Alex. Loved the spa and had an amazing experience with Jill and Claude who specialise in massage, reiki and meditation as guest therapists in the spa. THANK YOU Six Senses for making our honeymoon so special. We will be returning!"
"My wife and I visited the Six Senses in February and had a lovely time. Shortly after arrival, we were greeted by the management team and then introduced to our GEM (guest experience maker) Mila, who would make this stay even more memorable.  We booked one of the overwater villas on jetty A, which comes with a beautiful ocean view that is not blocked by other villas. There is surprisingly a lot to do on the island and Mila made sure that we received a schedule throughout our stay listing all the activities (complimentary and $$) / happy hour / dinner specials.  The snorkeling was fantastic as you can spot next to all kind of fish, turtles, reef sharks, sting and cow tail rays, and beautiful corals. Until this day, I want to say that the Six Senses offers the best food options‚Ä¶"
"Perfect service, spacious Villas, excellent Asian and Maledivian buffets, unbeatable friendly and competent team. best diving organization with very small groups (even if you're only two), Top Spa with various treatments"
"Second time here. Booked for three weeks, not two weeks like last year. Could have done 3 weeks more.. in fact We‚Äôd move there if we could.. the place is amazing. Thank you to ALL the staff, from management to housekeeping. You make this place. "
Amazing resort to visit for a vacation specially with family..I visited six sense laamu with my parents to celebrate their anniversary..From the arrival to departure everything was really been taken care of..Our GEM Aslah was always their when we needed..He was very polite & kind to my parents..Close the resort their are local islands which is really a interesting place to visit if u really want to know about how the locals of Maldives lives..We had an amazing vacation & hopefully we will be back soon..Thankyou again for Aslah who made our journey memorable:)
"Spectacular setting, beautiful villas, terrific staff and good food.  What more do you need?  The water was turquoise, the sand white and the sun bright.  Saw turtles (off the deck), dolphins, fish, lizards and fruit bats.  One of the highlights was being issued a bicycle and using it to get around.  Very relaxing.  Good food, especially breakfasts.  Free Ice Cream from noon to 10:30 pm is awesome.  Would compliment all of the staff we encountered as being helpful and friendly.  Would especially like to recognize our GEM Najah who was most helpful.  Also would recognize Meghan (Sustainability manager) and Nicole (Manta Rays) who were also helpful.  The wait staff was terrific and would recognize Jailim and Shark (obviously not his real name we joked about it).  In addition, the‚Ä¶"
"Went here with a group of friends. This place is absolutely amazing! Eco friendly and luxurious! Extremely helpful and friendly staff. Shout out to our GEM Abdullah who made our vacation perfect. Thank you, we will be back <3"
"My wife and I booked this trip for the tail end of my 50th birthday celebration and it was FANTASTIC.  They have their own herb garden on the island and their chef's are first class with innovative delicious offerings.  The package we booked included breakfast and  it had such a huge selection, we usually skipped lunch & just had dinner.  The prices for both the food and drinks were expensive (their average cocktail price was about $20) but I think that is just the Maldives in general.  Regardless, keep this in mind when choosing your package.   We stayed 5 nights in an over water villa and it was incredibly special and exquisitely beautiful.  Honestly, it was probably one of the most relaxing vacations that I have ever taken."
"It was one of the best trips I‚Äôve ever had, all the creatures (hermit crabs, crabs, lizards, dolphins, sharks, turtles, just to mention a few lol me and my friends saw were awesome, the island was so alive, the over water rooms were great and we saw several sharks going under the room.  The spa was amazing design wise and treatments,  The activities that can be done here are top notch.  And the 42 flavors of free ice cream is definitely one of the highlights of each day.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that would like to come."
Amazing resort! Loved everything about it. Super friendly staff and amazing activities available for everyone. Very infromative and learned so many different things about the environment and sustainability. Definitely 10/10 stay. Would visit again.
"First time we came to Six Senses Laamu was feb 2014. Our daughter was 1 year and we stayed at a beach villa. This year we came back (after trying out another resort in the Maldives last year) and this place just gets better and better.  Our daughter is now five, and we have a two year old son as well, so we wanted a villa with pool. After some deliberation we opted for a Ocean water villa with pool, and was not disappointed. IT WAS FABULOUS!  The villa, the pool, but first and foremost the view! It also felt safe because it is easy to have an overview over the children.   A new feature at the resort is the family pool at the beach, wich did not exist four years ago. A great place to hang out during the day when you want to a change in scenery.   The resort stands out because of‚Ä¶"
"First of all, this place is absolute paradise. From the moment we landed in the Maldives, we were treated like royalty. You meet a representative at the Male airport who checks you and all your bags in while you wait in the lounge (not the nicest lounge we‚Äôve been too, but still convenient). You take a short scenic flight from Male to their domestic airport. From there you take a 20 minute boat ride to the Laamu. You are welcomed with refreshing lemonade from the guides and given bags for your shoes. The resort has a no shoes, no problem vibe.. loved it! As you pull up to the glorious resort, you are welcomed by your own personal ‚ÄúGEM‚Äù. This is your manager who books all of your activities. You basically have them on speed dial. They were so helpful and always suggesting fun‚Ä¶"
"This place is nothing short of a paradise, amazing island and amazing villas on the water. It was perfect for relaxing - you could snorkle, sunbathe, have drinks, swim in the warm and calm water with turtles and colourful fish all day and never ever get bored. The staff was geniunely caring and the grounds extremely well kept. Its hard not to dream yourself back on a rainy day."
All the things and people here are nice. I‚Äôd Like to say that our GEM Kokko had gave us a wonderful honeymoon experience here. Thank u so much. I hope to be here next time if there was an opportunity. I love this place!
"I am a big, big fan of Six Senses brand, having stayed at a few other properties and Six Senses Laamu is just excellent as expected and more.  We stayed at the sunset beach villa with 2 kids aged 6 and 3.  We always stayed in luxury hotels and have done many family holidays every year with the kids and I have to say that by far, this is the most relaxing family holiday we have ever done.  Everything about the resort is kid friendly.  The kids go to the kids club all day, most of the time by themselves (the little one will be chaperoned back to the villa or they call you to pick up).  It's rather safe to walk from kids club to the villa especially if you ask for one that is close to it.  The kids love the free ice cream and the breakfast spread.  We had half board which was a‚Ä¶"
"Don't let the website put you off.  This is a wonderful eco friendly hotel (not at all corporate).  The staff are ALL lovely, always smiling and happy to help make sure you have the most wonderful stay.  The food was amazing, Michelin Star food every evening, huge breakfast selection - everything you could want to have available.  CJ and his bar team were fun and CJ made some fantastic cocktails to suit your taste - mine not sweet! 42 flavours of ice cream/sorbet made on the island and served all day by the happiest gorgeous young lady whose brother waited in the Leaf restaurant which gave us the most amazing food and service.  The resident marine biologists were so helpful and knowledgable. Pippa educated us on the coral and spent an hour talking to us about how our son could‚Ä¶"
"Fantastic hotel, incredible location and lovely staff. Our over water sunrise villa was faultless and our GEM Arif couldn‚Äôt do enough for us. We loved the sustainability angle the hotel pushed at all times and the food at the resort was great, especially breakfast which was the best we‚Äôve ever had!"
"Please let me use this platform to share our praise of Jailam - our waiter at breakfast and dinners at Longitude, Six Senses Laamu.  He has been so kind and attentive to us during the length of our stay, and he surely have made our stay a memorable one.  I can only hope the management team will recognise him for his outstanding, positive and professional service.   I will review the resort at a later point - my 5 stars purely goes to Jailam."
"from the moment we arrived, I was speechless.....welcomed with open arms and  introduced to our GEM Auzam who took us on an amazing tour of the six senses, most places don't live up to the pictures taken by photographers online but here the pictures don't do it justice!  our Gem Auzam was what my husband had called a genie, making every wish and desire we had come true,  he coordinated our days for us gave us suggestions, checked in on us, booked our dinners, excursions, you name it he did it...we were absolutely spoiled!!! we stayed in an over water bungalow with a pool all the way at the end of jetty C woke up to the beautiful sunrise everyday, we loved it so much we actually extended our stay and incurred a lot of change flight fees but it was worth it!!!  there was so many‚Ä¶"

"I booked this hotel for our honeymoon as I had seen the resort on lots of travel pages and blogs on Instagram. You do worry if will ever look like that, however this resort did not disappoint and looked exactly like those beautiful pictures!   From Male International airport were looked after all the way by Six Senses staff who checked us in and took care of our luggage. The most memorable part for me was when our boat pulled up to the resort and we were greeted first by the Manager of the resort straight off the boat who then went on to introduce her team. For me, this was customer service at its best. I just felt like we were really going to be looked after and we were during our stay.  We were allocated a GEM called Shifu who took care of us.

"Our second visit as we went to the opening in May 2011.  This time staying in an ocean beach villa as these weren't built in time for the opening. Lovely space in the villa/garden combined with a great beach and excellent sea swimming. Restaurant selection great and quality of food/drink high.  Service as good as you'd expect, nothing was a problem for our GEM, Abdulla."
"We just returned from four nights here to celebrate my fortieth birthday - it was an amazing, special experience. We travelled with our two little girls, 4 and 7, and we always worry how ‚Äòluxury resorts‚Äô will handle them, but Six Senses managed to make every moment special for them. Little things made such an impact- the GM Martine greeted us off the boat and asked my 4 year old the name of her deer toy (Melissa) then the next day we had a personalised blanket and bed for Melissa in our room. The head of kids club, Lala, also met us off the boat to give the kids special ‚Äòkids club passports‚Äô and get them excited about the activities. The marine biology staff spent lots of patient time teaching the kids about fish and turtles and nature. Our GEM (Guest Experience Maker), Arif,‚Ä¶"

My partner and I decided to book a last minute trip to the Maldives for November, we have stayed in a number of other resorts in the Maldives, Six Senses has been by far my favourite resort. From the minute you arrive on the boat, you are greeted with happy, relaxed vibes from the staff. We were told to take off our shoes and we would not be needing them for the rest of our stay, I cannot express how amazing this felt, just to feel the heat beneath your toes and the relaxed persona that it presented.

The diving center is good and well equipped, with some prime diving sites in the atoll.  Most important, all the staff is extremely courteous and attentive, everybody greets you when crisscrossing in the trails of the island.

Sixth time back in Laamu and everything is just as wonderful - if not better. The best snorkelling in the Maldives. Lovely walks on the beach around the island. The food is amazing (so much variety - even fresh eggs from their chickens!) and all the staff are delightful and so helpful. The GM is absolutely fantastic in going above and beyond in making sure you have an incredible l stay. The rooms are divine and I can‚Äôt think of anywhere better to be. Already looking forward to next time.
Second stay here. Favorite resort in the Maldives. Quiet and private. Amazing water bungalows with direct access to the ocean. Beautiful house reef and tons of fishes and marine life. Friendly dive center staff and helpful GEM (Abdulla). Would love to come back some time.
"My wife and I went to Six Senses Laamu for honemoon trip. Our expectations were high due to resort's own website and TripAdvisor reviews. But they were all met - and more. Everything was simply perfect, all the way from meet-and-greet at Male international airport to escorting to Male security control for departure. The transfer with regional flight and boat trip was made as comfortable as possible. Resort personnel greeted us upon arrival to their dock. Our GEM took us to our villa and explained everything worth knowing without it sounding like a recording. He was available at all times during our stay but not intrusive. The villa was just perfect (a sunset water villa), well equipped, clean and well-serviced with turn-down service etc. Excellent bed, exotic outdoor shower,‚Ä¶"
"We chose to spend our Christmas at Six Senses because of the house reef, and we were not disappointed. We've been to three resorts in the Maldives, and Six Senses was by far the best--the best in every way, really, but the snorkeling and sealife were truly incredible.  There's a spinner dolphin migration into the atoll every morning; you can watch them jump as you eat breakfast. A pod of bottleneck dolphins swam up to us on our very first snorkel. We saw reef sharks, turtles, rays, an octopus, a giant Napoleonfish, and countless varieties of groupers, surgeonfish, butterflyfish, and parrotfish--all from swimming out from shore. We brought our 7 year old daughter, and she was easily able to handle the calm waters.  As you'd expect in a five-star place, the staff was superb. Our‚Ä¶"
"This place was faultless - every little detail had been thought of in planning out this amazing island getaway. Being honeymooners, we obviously wanted to relax and unwind after the hustle and bustle of organising a wedding, and we were certainly able to do that - literally from the moment we landed at Male airport. Each and every team member of staff went above and beyond throughout our whole trip.  The beautiful greetings each and every morning, we truly felt like royalty while we were here.  Having always said that a trip to the Maldives would be a bucket list holiday, (a one off), we quickly changed our mind to a 10 year anniversary return. Simply amazing - I could type all day about this amazing place - and I haven‚Äôt even mentioned the beautiful views!   People = amazing.‚Ä¶"
"All the staff were very helpful and friendly, from the GM down. Especially our GEM (Guest Experience Maker) Kokko, who went over and above the call of duty to ensure our stay so memberable. A wide choice of resteraunts provided excellent food, and the breakfast buffet is incredible. All the accommodation was tastefully designed and made out of natural materials. Bicycles and bare feet for the week to travel around this idylic setting  all helped to make a super relaxing holiday. Lots of activities to choose from, and apart from a few days of mixed weather, this was a perfect holiday."
"Six Senses is certainly a paradise on earth. We were very happy we made the right decision and stayed in the one of the best places in Maldives. Our villa is gorgeous and is perfectly value-for-money. The staffs are friendly, accommodating and professional. The food was not exceptional. Ice cream parlor was the best though. The spa was nice and their treatment nests are more beautiful as the pictures, we had a blissful time in all of our three massages. The resort is beautiful and the people, stunning view, exclusivity are the key to your entire experience."
"This was our second time to the Maldives and were blown away by everything that Six Senses Laamu had to offer.  From a seamless booking process, to arrival, we had a truly unique experience.  On arrival we were met by the GM and her crew of GEMs. We received a warm welcome before being introduced our GEM. Najah was his name and you‚Äôd be lucky if he is your GEM. After our welcoming, we were taken to our villa.   Before staying at the Six Senses Laamu we did extensive research on the rooms - we looked at other guests videos, and insta pics on the internet. The rooms are absolutely amazing. We stayed as a couple in an overwater Laamu water villa facing sunrise. The room is spacious and and very comfortable with everything you‚Äôd need for a great stay.  Najah showed us around the‚Ä¶"
"The setting makes this resort. Marine life around the resort is great. Rays, sharks, turtles and an ecosystem of fish swim around the villas. The house reef is thriving - it‚Äôs just a few swim strokes away from the bar. And the villas overlook a sandy lagoon with sea grass patches where turtles like to hide. We spent many hours in the water gawking at the undersea life.   We stayed in an ocean water villa - didn‚Äôt seem to be much difference between that and the other over water villas in terms of location. If I‚Äôm back again I would go for one of the (slightly cheaper) overwater lagoon villas. There aren‚Äôt any totally unobstructed views - you‚Äôll be fairly close to your neighbours on the jetties and you can hear what‚Äôs going on around you. No pool villas were available when I‚Ä¶"
"Great service, fantastic food, beautiful location, amazing aquatic life, all in a informal, low key, luxurious package.  Excellent weather and the over water villa was our perfect home.  Had lots of fun and great memories to take home (SeaBob, paddle boarding, snorkling and scuba diving)."
"We stayed for 6 days on our honeymoon and it was an absolute dream come true. The service was spectacular and the location was breath taking.  Our GEM (Guest Experience Maker) Najah was nothing less than amazing.  He helped us experience the most out of our stay in the resort and made it an experience of a lifetime. For that, we are forever grateful. We highly recommend this resort, it is nothing less than perfect. Thank you to the entire team at Six Senses Laamu for making our honeymoon the best days of our lives.     Sincerely,Chris & Jenny"
"Choosing a resort in the Maldives is not an easy thing to do. Six Senses was on our top 5 in dozens of resorts we had on our radar. We are glad we made this choice.  We stayed 7 nights total, 3 in a Beach Villa and 4 in a Water Villa, both with private pool. Both experience was great, of you pick that option I recommend having the Water Villa for the last.  Food was great and Service is a 5 stars! All the Hosts are very friendly, it looks like an experience from another world!  Thank you all the host and our GEM Ali, who was in charge of delivering an excellent experience!"
"If you can‚Äôt be bothered to read the very long list of positives then here is the summary. The Six Senses Laamu is a paradise with not one fault. The staff make the place what it is. Our best holiday ever and Six Senses Laamu now takes the number one position in favourite hotels and pushes our previous favourite, the Villa d‚ÄôEste in Lake Como into Number 2 spot. We are definitely going to head back to Laamu in 2019  Positives The staff - every single person was so friendly and helpful whether it was the person cleaning our room, the staff looking after the herb and vegetable garden or the staff in the restaurants. Great management team.  Ashfaq, our Guest Experience Maker, also known as Coco. An absolute gentleman, legend and expert on how to provide an amazing holiday. He‚Ä¶"
"every detail was the best for more than 20 years. the beach villa, the restaurants,the beach and the personal.we had really good and luxury holidays.travelling from zurich to your island is a bit heavy, but already on your speedboat everything is out of mind.  CONGRATULATION"
"This is the 3rd time we have visited six senses Laamu and hopefully not the last. It proves that it is possible to be both eco friendly and luxury. The setting is stunning with restaurants and villas set over the water where a gentle breeze offsets the heat of the sun. The chill bar was our favourite spot. From here you can slip into the water and snorkel the reef directly, spotting turtles , rays ,reef sharks and fish galore. Then in the evening it is the perfect place to watch the sunset while enjoying drinks and bar snacks.   The overwater villas are spacious with a lovely outdoor shower area over the sea and glass baths. They have large terraces with sunken tables ,days beds and lounging areas.   Everywhere the staff are charming and genuinely friendly. They seem to take‚Ä¶"
"Absolutely delightful property!  Really felt as though we were in paradise! Loved everything about - specifically, biking around the island, snorkeling in the the incredible house reef, relaxing at the spa, and having all out needs met by the extremely efficient (and kind!) GEM Mafaz.  Six Senses has really raised thd bar for our future holidays!! "
"we visited six senses laamu in august and i think my family still talks about the trip several times a week with hearts in our eyes. we were there for almost two weeks with our 4 and 5 year old. from the second we arrived until the minute we sailed off to the airport (we were all crying when we had to leave), it was magical.   I'm not even going to get into the specialness of the maldives, bc that is just implied and also something you needy to see for yourself. im here to review six senses lama and the hotel is the most beautiful i have ever seen.   the people who work at the resort are all the kindest most helpful most friendly people we have encountered.    the kids club made my kids feel so welcome and taught them so much during our stay. from bike rides to the islands water‚Ä¶"
"If you are considering a honeymoon, babymoon, or any kind of moon you will not be disappointed. From the very moment we were greated by our GEM, Abdullah,we knew this was going to be special. Our over the water Villa came complete with bikes and personalised plates (island style), scuba gear, the best outdoor bathroom I have ever seen, and of course a show of dolphins and turtles from our very own deck each day. We went sailing, snorting, kyaking ... You can do as little, or as least as you like. The staff served up a delicious breakfast every morning, and our dinners at the various restaurants were exquisite. Our favourite though was the lobster BBQ on the beach - such a special time and thanks to Abdullah for ensuring it!"
"Amazing room with great facilities, very friendly, Feels home, Great experience. I really hope i get the chance to this resort again. Foods and drinks are delicious, This place is really great, good facilities for couples and families with children, we really had a great time."
"This is a very long winded review to basically convey our feeling that Six Senses Laamu is the e place to go if you are planning a honeymoon in the Maldives!  From the moment we stepped foot on the island until the moment we left we received the best service and created the most amazing memories for our honeymoon. We knew that this would be the trip of a lifetime, but the staff at Six Senses honestly went above and beyond to make our experience truly memorable.   Our GEM (Guest Experience Maker and essentially personal vacation assistant), Najah, was supremely amazing. He was friendly, helpful, and incredibly attentive to our preferences. He booked an amazing (surprise) massage and several great dinners for us when we just simply didn‚Äôt feel like making any decisions. And he was‚Ä¶"
"When you travel over 30 hours to get somewhere, it better be great.  And this place is great.  So much we came here in 2017 and came back this year.    We considered other resorts but chose to come back to Six Senses Laamu because there is nothing to improve or that we would want to change.  Great vibe to the resort.  It is respectful to the environment and to locals.  In turn they offer great scenery and diving.  Service is always perfect, people are professional, discreet and effective.   Restaurant options and food quality is impressive.   Diving is impressive:  VIP service and close by dive sites.  Rays, sharks, and so many fishes.  The atoll is isolated with only one resort so there are plenty of interesting sites and coral is beautiful.  Travel light.  No need for shoes or‚Ä¶"
"We went to six senses quite a while ago (a few years ago) and since then we have gone to many other hotels and holidays, nothing beats six senses. Best service ever with astonishing rooms and fabulous food.   It is very kid friendly and the bikes are an amazing idea. Six senses is absolutely fabulous and we highly recommend!"
"I have tried reading and re-reading the reviews of this place,, almost all of them seem to say it's a 'paradise' out there in Six Senses. This made me question myself if maybe our expectations were too high or were we particularly unlucky?  Whilst there have been many things we appreciated a lot, we felt there was a room for improvement, particularly, considering high prices and expectations of 'luxury' (albeit barefoot) the hotel create through their marketing.  We really liked the beautiful setting of the resort, the villas, the food (especially, breakfast!), the bicycles, the eco-friendly initiatives, the snorkelling and the turtles,  and, of course, the ice-cream.  And we would have been very happy with our experience should have the resort been more reasonably priced, but‚Ä¶"
"We had never spent such a lovely time. Your HOTEL let your guest to be part of the Nature, in perfect harmony with the enviroment. It is luxurious and sustainable, great and hospitable, we love how you make guests feel there, amazing! Looking strongly forward to come back, it has been a breath of health. The staff, excelent, they are part of the your success, special thanks to our GEM Auzam!!"
"We stayed at Laamu for our honeymoon - we don't usually go on exotic beach holidays. Long haul travel to the Maldives isn't a lot of fun, but from the first second we arrived at Male airport the Laamu staff were first rate. They met us in Arrivals, and left us in a lounge while they dealt with out domestic transfer. Once we landed at our final airport we had a very pleasant speedboat ride across the the resort itself.  The staff were amazingly friendly during our stay and couldn't do enough to help us. They had an incredible knack of being attentive without ever being overbearing.  The food was excellent, which is important when you're pretty much stuck on the island. There was always plenty of choice with four restaurants, and everything was good quality. If you're going, try‚Ä¶"
"It was the best place I have ever visited. The island is so beautiful, the staff are incredible. The food and drinks are delicious with so many choices between the restaurants. The snorkelling is magical, the turtles swimming outside our bedroom every day was a real highlight."
"Six Senses Laamu delivered on every aspect! From the personal touch of having a GEM (Abdulla) making sure that our every need was looked after and our whole trip personalised to suit us. A resort where we were spoilt by the luxury comforts of life but where we were able to comfortably unwind and become one with the natural environment was amazingly executed!   The house reef was amazing full of corals, fish and sea turtles. Loved that we could go for a snorkel or dive with our knowledgable diving coach Petty and then chill out by the bar for lunch.    Having a separate private island for resort guests to explore and have to ourselves was the experience to top it all. A private reef swim with our entertaining guide Farid and romantic picnic island lunch was a very memorable‚Ä¶"
"We‚Äôve been at Six Senses for 7 nights for our honeymoon. Me and my husband had the most wonderful days of our lives and we will never forget about this amazing place! A bit far from the city but all worth the journey, we were welcomed by big smiles from the management and escorted by our own gem. To go around the island bicycles with initials are provided, enjoy the ride! There is a stunning sand bank, small piece of island of the resort, can be reached by small boat but also by swimming and it is a spot so beautiful that looks out of this world, perfect for honeymooners like us. Overall Six Senses Laamu is truly incredible achievement in luxury and natural beauty. I would recommend anybody looking for an island paradise to consider coming here, just make sure you book 1 week‚Ä¶"
"Everything was beyond amazing in this place, so sureal! How could you ever forget the scenic views in a rustic chic beach villa. Cannot fault anything here- food, service, place. My gem and kids club ladies deserve an applause our daughter love the kids place and cried all the way to the airport during our departure. This resort has a perfect fusion of total relaxation and true luxury. Beaches around the island is breathtaking as well. I would like to highly recommend a stay here!"
"My wife and I recently travelled to the Six Senses Laamu resort from Perth Western Australia, the 18hrs + travel to get there was worth every minute. All too often we have checked out our destination on the websites and nearly always find there are elements of disappointment with the real life resort compared to what you see on the website, let me say that this resort is far better than the website displays on every level. We stayed in a Lagoon Beach Pool Villa and in our opinion was the best choice for us, this villa gave us an almost private beach and walk-in access to small reef right at our doorstep which was abundantly filled with all manner of fish and sea life, we spent many hours snorkelling watching the underwater view, for those interested our Villa number was 55. The‚Ä¶"
"This place is run by the lovely and very enthusiastic Dutch General Manager Marteyne. She is the one that together with the entire Six Senses team made sure me and my brother had a fantastic time during your stay on this magical island deep in the south of the Maldives.  On the very first morning we were told to come and swim with the manta rays. We were on our way to our very first breakfast, but Marteyne convinced us to have breakfast later and to join them on the boat to witness this amazing sight. And within 5 minutes we were swimming amongst 5 to 6 manta rays in the Indian Ocean. What a treat! And that was just the beginning of it all.  During the next 2 weeks me and my brother went scuba diving very often. The Deep Blue Divers Dive Centre is just perfect with Lauren, Sasha‚Ä¶"
"Really great experience on six senses laamu. You can snorkeling in front of your room. Food are delicious and diverse. You can taste from Asia food, local to western style of foods. A lot of activities on the island you can participate."
"We are still raving about this place up to now. We went there to celebrate honeymoon. Everything was perfect and marvelous. From start to end, I can say, it is an island dream holiday! We are in awe when we step in the resort, beaches, view are unique and breathtaking as well.  Six senses laamu gives the meaning of high end luxury and pure nature.  A bit pricey, but well worth it as you see the most amazing gift of nature and marine life. A warm thought and thanks to our gem Afrah, he was great and very attentive to us from our arrival to departure. I would highly recommend this island for a stay, an escape, a honeymoon, an anniversary, name it, they will have it! This is an absolute paradise on earth!"
"This place is heaven on earth! From the moment you step foot on the island (literally, they have a barefoot island policy!) you are spoilt. We loved our overwater villa, the outdoor shower was stunning with the underwater garden. The food was delicious, breakfast was a highlight! So many incredible options. Don‚Äôt forget your sunscreen though like we did, very very expensive!!! We would love to go back but it is very remote. The flight from male to laamu was very expensive so make sure you consider that cost as well as there is no other option."
"My family and I enjoyed an incredible stay at this stunning location.  For families looking for a top quality resort that also provides some wonderful activities for everyone, this place is worth a visit.  We snorkeled, surfed and swam our way through two charming weeks.  We were circled by white tip sharks on a pristine reef (very safe), had baby turtles run over our feet as they hatched, caught some thrilling waves out surfing, managed to swim with dolphins and enjoyed many sunsets in a perfect location.  Staff were very friendly, TropicSurf were great for the surfing side (big shout out to Ben and Olena, and also Maia for the snorkeling).  Best of all was the free ice-cream bar.  Most fun we've had in the Maldives."
I stayed at Six Senses Laamu for 7 nights and the only bad thing about this place is that you have to leave it some day. The service is impeccable and the staff is very forthcoming and helpful. I would like to mention and thank our GEM Shifu for taking care of us during our stay and for always making sure we had a good time during our stay. I would also like to thank Trevor Liu for always having the time to stop up and talk to us and making sure we were alright and thank you Trevor for the kind gift you made us. I can't complain about the food since every meal we had was wonderful. The taste and the staff in every restaurants was impeccable. The icecream parlor has one of the best sortiment of flavours and the taste is flawless. I also like this resort because of the‚Ä¶
Wonderful place to spend some days relaxing and snorkelling. We suggest the water villa with private pool and the picnic at the resort private island. Just amazing! Unfortunately the weather at the end of October didn't allow su to experience the private dinner at the sand bank. Next time .. hopefully!
"Enjoyed a delightful stay in this resort at the end of October & it surpassed all of our expectations. From arrival in the airport, the SixSenses care was exquisite. We stayed in an overwater villa on jetty A & loved every second.  The rooms & the resort overall are so well laid out & maintained to an impeccable standard.  (Whoever is repsonsible for the planning of this resort deserves a gold star!). We were surprised at the lack of (small) fish around Jetty A - although daily there were many sightings of eagle rays, other rays & big turtles which was really cool.  After speaking to some of the resort‚Äôs marine biology team, we were advised that the best snorkelling is at the house reef in front of the Sip Sip restaurant & this was indeed wonderful.  The envionmentally‚Ä¶"
"We had a magical holiday with beautiful surroundings, amazing food, the kindest & friendliest staff and amazing scuba diving.  In particular Petty was amazing at helping me experience my first dive after 15 years - putting at ease!  The fish were amazing and we saw Eagle ray, manta rays, reef sharks, hawsbill turtles, green turtle, dolphins and much more."
"This resort absolutely surpassed our expectations, from incredible healthy food, an amazing surfing experience and the warmth of hospitality from the staff. We felt as if we were in an over water tree house with all the luxuries you could want. Our GEM, Ravah, was everything you could need. He catered to all of our needs and was very attentive to our overall experience, but more than anything we felt like we had a friend to ask if we needed anything at all, he made the stay something special. This resort is the perfect fit for anyone looking to experience the serenity of the southern Maldive Atolls. Thank you for the wonderful stay!"
Six Sense provide personalized experience in all senses. Our GEM Shifu was excellent was concerned about our stay and booking the restaurants/events. Restaurants are great but the leaf restaurant is outstanding. Another person who helped the experience was Shifan taking care of our room during the stay. I do recommend staying at six sense at Maldives. 
"Probably the best place in the world for the unique combination of relaxing, luxury food and underwater experiences. We cannot wait to go back:o) The friendly and competent staff at the dive center (Deep Blue) guided all of us safely and fun through different PADI-courses."
"SS Laamu was the final stay on our 3 resort 25th wedding anniversary trip. Everybody we met there had something interesting or informative to talk to us about. The room was spacious and beautifully appointed and cleaned several times a day. The outdoor shower was glorious after spending hours in the ocean. We had a Laamu water villa and were spoiled for places to sit and gaze in to the water to watch the aquatic life flow by. Don‚Äôt forget to climb the stairs to the roof deck when the stars come out. Having food allergies made it important to pick a resort that understands how to deal with them, and Chef Stefan and his entire team made sure that every meal was as carefully vetted for allergens as it was for deliciousness. Our GEM was always on hand to help us plan our activities‚Ä¶"
"We have just checked out after a week in Six Senses Laamu. It has been a fantastic stay. The resort is beautiful and our villa was beautiful. However, the most fantastic part about the resort is the staff. The restaurant staff, the cleaning staff, the marine biologists, the guest relation manager Trevor, the guy making the ice cream, the GEMs, the team serving the ice cream, everyone was so passionate about making our stay wonderful. A special shout out to our amazing GEM Shifu who went beyond and above to make sure that we had a pleasant stay. We were also fortunate that the astronomist, Dr. Parag, was at the resort during our stay. Watching the Milky Way while listening to interesting facts about it was spectacular.  The whole concept of having presentation and talks on marine‚Ä¶"
Out two week vacation at Six Senses was excellent and truly relaxing.We like to mention especially the scuba diviing/diving center Deep Blue Divers. The guides are excellent and were very helpful in giving hints with regards to under water photography. Pls keep up the friendliness and professionalism. Besides diving also the guides from Tropicsurf were alwasy superb.Our GEM Tom and the overall service were impeccable.We will come back.
"room was beautiful, people nice, restaurants the best and Maldives the paradise! it is 5 restaurants, we check all of them and the bar is even great. all the activities are great experience to do like diving, surfing, etc."
"Simply amazing. Best service for a long time. We stayed in 2016. Kids club was fantastic. I am currently at another resort on the Maldives, wishing we had booked the six senses again. Said resort doesn‚Äôt even come close in terms of experience. "
"We had an amazing time at Six Senses Laamu this summer. The service, the villa and the food was incredible. The relaxed yet luxurious atmosphere and the attentiveness of the international staff is what really sets this resort apart. Must try: Couples massage, pancakes for breakfast, burnt milk ice cream and the sushi at Zen.   Would go back any time!!!"
"We stayed at Six Senses Laamu for our honeymoon in September for seven wonderful nights. The experience began as soon as we arrived into Male where we were greeted and personally checked in for our domestic transfer flight before being led to the lounge. After a short flight, we then boarded the speed boat onto paradise. Upon boarding the speed boat, we were invited to begin our Six Senses Laamu adventure by taking off our shoes as well as given a refreshing homemade lemonade.   Once we arrived to the resort, we were greeted by a host of staff and each introduced to our Guest Experience Maker (GEM), Carel as well as the wider team who make it all possible.   Everything about the resort is beautifully thought out, every little detail from all the fittings and fixtures to the‚Ä¶"
"What a hotel. Had gone for my friends 40th. The hotel is amazing - the views, the rooms all facing the ocean simply breathtaking. Although it is a flight and a boot ride away from Male but once u reach the resort your are just taken to a lap of luxury and beauty which makes the journey worth it. "
"We had very high expectations - and they were all met if not exceeded, in every way. The entire resort is absolutely amazing, everything is in excellent condition, the style and feel of it all was so worked through. It is total luxury but in a very relaxed and low key way. We had everything we needed and never missed anything, maybe except a couple more weeks here. The food was fantastic and very varied, with spices beeing grown directly on the island, a high quality level and every chance to eat both healthy and diliciously.  We loved the sunset pool villa we were in, being placed at the farthest end of one of the pier. This meant that there it quiet and nice - and we had a most spectacular view due east with sunrise directly on our porch. The villa is more or less completely‚Ä¶"
"We had a wonderful stay with our 7 month old at Six Senses Laamu for one week.   We chose Six Senses mainly because of the food, which did not disappoint.  Applaud goes to the chef at the Leaf.  The food was so good that we ended up dining three nights there during our stay.  Part of their secrets could be their home grown herbs and vegetables.  We did find one or two meat courses a bit too salty for our taste.  We were from Hong Kong so we tend to take food less salty.  We also enjoyed our time at their Japanese restaurant Zen where visiting chef Miki cooked us a fusion dinner.  Not to mention the wine dinner we had at the Altitude, where sommelier Vjay tempted us with selected wines around the world.  If you enjoyed food, this resort should not disappoint.  This resort is very‚Ä¶"
"We flew in by sea plane over the mesmerising Atolls, followed by a fast boat to Laamu, to be greeted by the Sixsenses Laamu General Manager and Team, who made us feel most welcome, introducing the team members, after our long journey ...  We nestled down on the terrace of our water villa watching the Sun slowly bow out ... and make way for the glittering constellation ...  Our Sunset Villa had rustic local charm, offering comfort and excitement - loved the out door shower and over water clear glass bath tub, not forgetting of course, the terrace over our back garden - no green lawn,  just the Indian Ocean!  Every guest has a ‚ÄòGuest Experience Manager‚Äô (GEM) who ensures guests get the most out of their experience at the resort.  Thanks to our GEM (Arif) who was a real ‚ÄòGem‚Äô, we‚Ä¶"
"Stayed five nights with family of four, had an amazing time. Stayed at one of the family pool villas, spacious and super comfy, staff members are going the extra mile from morning until evening with a big smile. Kids club offers a variety of activities, which were truly awesome and appreciated by our children. Kokko thanks for making our stay a memorable one, and Marteyne thanks a million for making our life a milestone richer! We are back! "
We went to the six senses Laamu for our honeymoon. It was our first time in the Maldives and we were not disappointed. The resort and island is breathtakingly beautiful. We enjoyed lounging on the deck of our overwater bungalow but also spent time at chill bar and sip sip. The staff are so friendly and the food was outstanding. We ate mostly at leaf for dinner however attended the two buffet nights which were also very good. Our GEM Afrah was amazing. He booked all our activities and made our stay seamless. We also did the back of house tour which was very interesting and highly recommend if you have the time.   We can‚Äôt wait to come back for our anniversary :)   Thank you Six Senses Laamu.
"It was our first time in the Maldives and this holiday gave us the reason to come back for more! I‚Äôm missing our villa fronting the wide blue ocean, you couldn‚Äôt ask for more waking up in the nicest view on earth. Our gem took care of everything and felt the royalty feeling everywhere. An added experience to see the local island nearby meeting people and see how they live, this was so interesting. There‚Äôs so many things to say about this place, but the only word hail from my mind is MAGICAL! We‚Äôd like to thank everyone that made this holiday perfect. In particular, Abdulla, Nazru, Java, Hsham and others I cannot remember all the names. We absolutely loved Six Senses Laamu, it is amazing, service is topnotch, cant‚Äô wait to revisit! Traveled with friends"
"The pictures not he internet does not do this place any justice. Yes, the photos are absolutely amazing but to be there, to actually experience it - that is the real gift.   Admittedly, getting to the resort requires a bit of patience and traveling tolerance. We had to take 3 airplane trips and one quick boat ride. That's part of the adventure, actually.   One may not be able to process how sustainable tourism can be luxurious, but apparently, it is possible! Barefoot luxury is the ethos of Six Senses Laamu - join the club, no pressure at all but trust me, go on and join the club because it is just absolutely cathartic to walk around with nothing between you and nature - just as how it should be.  From the personalised touches (wooden bike monograms) to your own GEM (Guest‚Ä¶"
"From the moment you arrive and take your shoes off this is an exceptional experience. The accomodation is 5+ star with every little thing thought of, you own push bike to get around and your own Guest Experience Maker (GEM) to make sure your stay is perfect. The snorkeling and scuba diving is excellent and the meals in all the 5 restaurants were first class. "
"Multiple times to Six Senses resorts, always understated and tasteful and Laamu is one of the best - room service to your overwater villa is hard to beat.  Swimming fantastic.  Gym has high quality equipment."
"We just returned from an incredible 5 nights at Six Senses Laamu. There are hundreds of resorts to choose from in the Maldives, I am confident we chose the right one.  We really felt at home, on a luxurious, uniquely beautiful island. The staff were excellent, so friendly. I‚Äôm a fan of the Six Senses brand, previously staying at Yao Noi and loving it. I have been following Six Senses for a couple of years and really like the brands‚Äô philosophy etc.   Rooms - very impressive. We stayed in the Laamu over the water with pool room type, the furthest room from the lobby/restaurants, (it had the most privacy) and we were happy to be ‚Äúactive‚Äù and ride our bikes around the island. The Bose system in the room is excellent, and loved the glass windows on the floor!   Food - the food at‚Ä¶"
"This was our first trip to Maldives and we loved it so much! Everything is perfection, I found Six Senses Laamu to be the best place we‚Äôve ever stayed before. Amazing spa, unforgettable yoga sessions it was great to meditate by looking and facing at the wonderful lagoon. Exceptionally fab people around, we would love to visit this magical place again!"
"This is actually my first-ever Trip Advisor review...and mostly due to the fantastic staff at Deep Blue Divers. I did my Rescue Diver (and Emergency First Responder) course at Six Senses and truly, the guys and girls at Deep Blue Divers are to be commended. Special shout out to Patty (not sure if it's the correct spelling for your name - sorry lovely!) who helped me through the EFR course ( I will remember to avoid saying 'Oh Nooooo' I promise!) and to my *fantastic* instructor Danilo for teaching me so much over a relatively short time, and managing to both make me a much better diver and buddy, as well as combine the course with some fantastic dives, which meant I could enjoy the instruction but also revel in the beauty of the atoll. Grazie Dani! I won't forget you!!!"
"We traveled to the Maldives with 7 friends to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary. This was the most amazing experience. The personnel were very accommodating and pleasant at all times. The free ice cream daily was definitely a bonus after hanging out in the sun/water all day. The resort was very peaceful and serene. We absolutely loved our GEM Tom! We decided to do a barbque dinner on the sand bar for our celebration. The staff went above and beyond to assist in making sure everything was lovely including adjusting the time frame to ensure we could celebrate before the rain came. The rooms were large, very well decorated, extremely clean with a view of the water that was breathless.  They also provide you with bikes to travel around the island, so we went bike riding a few‚Ä¶"
"We think of ourselves as tough critics but this property and the way it is managed is truly exceptional. From the friendly and helpful service to the extraordinary food, resort design, social and environmental initiatives, staying a this property is worth every cent. We left reinvigorated and inspired and would definitely recommend to anyone wanting this type of luxury eco experience. A truly magical place."

Serviced twice a day to perfection.   Restaurants and Service No 7 star resort is complete without 7 star service! The service is second to none. From the moment we stepped on the island we were greeted and received a warm welcome by the resident manager Graeme and some of his management team.  From all bar men to every restaurant staff‚Ä¶"
"Definitely the most beautiful jewel on earth, thanks to its geographical location. Wonderful how this resort manages to emerge completely into the beauty of nature. Above all this, an extremely gentle staff, with their eyes focused on every detail. A special thanks to Afrah, our GEM, who took care of us during our stay. Also to Sharwaan, our personal table assistant. As a diving family, we want to thank the deep blue divers, Achim and Valerio, who showed us with their experience sharks, mantas, turtles and many colourful fishes. Yes, we have to speak with superlatives over this 10 days experience ..."
"Our six senses holiday is a total incredible experience! Where to begin? full assistance from the airport to local airport to boat crew heading to their island. We‚Äôre asked to remove our shoes to set our island mood and feel the ‚Äúbarefoot luxury‚Äù concept  which we loved and abided the entire stay. Crazy colors everywhere, blue ocean ‚Äìin different hues, white beach, colorful sunsets, colored fishes, all blends perfectly! Few people stands out for us, Naseem (our guest experience maker), my therapist sorry forgot her name, our sweet lady at Den Jovy, thanks for welcoming the kids every single day! Servers at breakfast were all attentive and professional. The food is excellent, Leaf was our favorite, dinner with ocean breeze coming in. Ice cream is a nice touch and clearly many‚Ä¶"
"We stayed at villa nr 60 from 11-19 september. We have never had such a perfect vacation like this one! First of all , the accomodation , the beach, the rooms and the food were just perfect! I want to put the staff in the spotlight because they made us holiday unforgettable. I‚Äôll start with the dive crew, we went diving several times with Achim , Valerio and betty. We couldn‚Äôt imagine a better dive crew to join us. They took care of us very well. We had a fun time at the boot. In the longitude restaurant Sharwaan and Jazlaan served us every morning and evening. They really think about everything and they always remembered our little requests so we didn‚Äôt have to ask the same thing twice. Also they were very interested and we had nice talks with them!

"Our stay at Six Senses was just amazing!!!  People. All of the staff who work there are just the most charming individuals who will look after you to the highest of standards....nothing is beyond their consideration.  Food. The food was sublime...easily the best food we have eaten, the menus changed daily so there was never a case of being bored of the menus over our stay, many ingredients are grown on the island. INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!  Surf. The team at Tropic Surf were the best and they made everything so easy!  They provide the best surfing service but will also go that extra mile to help you out. The surf at Laamu provides something for everyone...be it beginner lessons or the mighty Yin Yang a short boat ride away. The surfing experience with Tropic Surf was the reason we went‚Ä¶"
"There is a lot to say, but instead I just like to say that it is a wonderful place to visit. We travel quite a bit and tend to stay at 5 star hotels. Six Senses Laamu turned out to be one of the best at all levels and directions; from its staff to its units and dining options and more. Don't miss to visit this location, and don't forget to get a massage too. All in all it has been a priceless experience. It's worth it."
"More than paradise!!! It is not easy to describe this place‚Ä¶..everything is perfect and astounding! My husband and I had the right decision choosing this resort for our Maldives holiday. We loved every small detail and exceeded far our expectations. Travelling is worthy once your eyes set on the island. Villas are huge we love lazing  on the deck sofa staring at the stunning view present 24/7. We got a classy bedroom, a unique shower area. Everything in the room is just luxurious and romantic! The food was great but not in all outlets, our FAV is the breakfast with overflowing food every day. We loved seeing the dolphins swimming by to greet us in the morning, how cool is that?!  Free ice cream too is the best part of the day and this became kids afternoon delight. A very‚Ä¶"
"The six senses Laamu is just unique. From the moment your get on the boat and take your shoes off to the moment you leave everything is perfect. The people who work there are like family, the food is just incredible and all the different accommodations are amazing. I really recommend to everyone to go there!!! Thanks again to everyone and hope to see you soon again. All the best!!!"
"We came to Laamu my husband and I with our two boys (21 and 17 years old). We all had an unforgettable experience, enjoying this blue paradise with amazing snorkelling and diving. Loved the slow life atmosphere, the comfortable over the water villas, the food and specially our sea activities with the enthusiastic Risla. All the staff were very nice and kind.It was our third time in Maldives and we still dream to get to know its amazing sea wild life. We very much support Laamu's sustainability philosophy. Well done guys! Hope we come back soon!"
"This hotel is something very special. The amenities, staff and setting are all amazing. They have thought of everything in your room: beach bag, pillow menu, all toiletries, robes and slippers, mini bar is amazing, ample towels etc. The staff were all amazing and helpful - nothing is too much trouble. The options for activities was incredible, we didn't have time to do them all! Water sports and the Marine Biologist team were amazing, The House Reef has incredible snorkelling - turtles, rays and reef sharks as well as amazing fish! The food was all amazing - the breakfast is something special - anything you could ever want! The complimentary ice creams were delicious. Overall the is one of the best hotels we have ever been to - both in terms of setting, staff and the general‚Ä¶"
"Our stay was just amazing. The overall relaxed atmosphere of the entire resort with the fabulous service of the staff really made us enjoy our holiday, especially the care and attention our Gem Mila gave to our 2 year old daughter was heart warming. We have already travelled extensively across the globe, and stayed in luxurious resorts everywhere, but the service we got in the Six Senses Laamu, surpassed all our prior experiences.  Also the diving was very nice in the Laamu atoll as Six Senses is the only resort in this Atoll, due to which dive sites are not swamped with other divers, and the coral is still in a very good condition. We were also lucky to see a lot of white tip sharks on almost all our dives."
"I had the chance to visit Six Senses Laamu with my family last month and I have to say it's been great in every possible way.   The staff was really really nice, always with a smile and kind words to say, and took care of even the smallest detail, which is the most important aspect an hotel can offer, as I see it. Thanks to our GEM, Alex, who made us feel at home.  The food (and ice creams) are great, with a wide offer of dishes from different places.  I would only like to highlight its dive center, Deep Blue Divers. Definitely, diving in Maldives was an extraordinary experience for all of us, with a really professional team, and I'd like to specially thank Petty and Valerio for their constant help and patience, when organising dives and courses, and for taking such good care of‚Ä¶"
"Do not hesitate to visit! You will find the warmest of welcome from every member of staff and the greatest attention to detail in every aspect of your stay. The water villas are exquisite, you can‚Äôt fail to relax. The resort has wonderful water sport facilities. I learnt to dive, the dive team are fabulous, patient, professional and passionate about their environment."
"Wonderfully hotel! Great atmosphere, fantastic service!  Recommendation visit SPA I think it is best spa center at Maldives! ECO style of atmosphere and food and all around is great! Thank you very much all team of hotel!"
"My husband and I had the most wonderful time at the Six Senses.  The whole trip was an experience without fault.  From the moment you step off the plane at Kadhdhoo Airport you are treated with the most amazing service.  I don't even know where to begin!   The whole island is kept beautifully.  The gardens, beaches and restaurants were clean, aesthetically pleasing and designed to make the most of the stunning locations.  The over the water villa we stayed in was perfect, it contained everything we needed and more.  It was classified as a lagoon view, however we had wonderful views of the lagoon, ocean, and island.  We could still see other villas, but they did not detract from the natural and peaceful views.  The room was comfortable, nice and cool with the aircon and the‚Ä¶"
"The warm down to earth hospitality is unbeatable... for someone who had the  opportunity to visit several resorts in the Maldives , Six Senses definitely is number one .... not a single staff without the welcoming smile , you can ask for anything - the team will find a solution :-) ... Six senses is a place where you can basically tick all the boxes on your holiday list ....great surfing for all levels , private dive sites as they are the only dive operators ...beautiful white sandy beaches , own house Reef where u have access for snorkeling and diving from the shore .... Love the green and the no shoes concept ... the paths are all sand where they have taken utmost care to clear away as less trees as possible ...  Marine team does an excellent job in educating the Laamu‚Ä¶"
Perfect hotel for a family vacation under the sun. Top infrastructure. Excellent beach and facilities. Very professional service where everything is simple thanks to the good work of the GEMs. Good and healthy food in all restaurants. The hotel is concerned with nature. Good team of biologists are available to provide any explanation about the surrounding nature. We will certainly be back next year. 
"Could this place get any better ??   Ok Where to start!  The buffet breakfast was simply amazing! Many choices and also for myself vegan and gluten intolerant there were many choices available for me. Watch for the dolphins or eagle rays visiting at breakfast.  I stayed in a beach villa, I really loved the outdoor private showers and the fact I could just walk off the balcony and straight into the ocean. Oh and the pillow menu just blew me away. For me who normally struggles to sleep I had the best sleep I have had in over four months.  The spa was second to none.  There was a range of treatments to choose from and the therapists are really professional. My favourite treatment was the relaxed feet treatment and the Ariel yoga is a must do!   I also did a discover scuba dive with‚Ä¶"
"Our fourth trip to Laamu and we will be back again next year as you can‚Äôt beat this resort worldwide for 5 star service, quality and variety of food, stylish and tasteful accomodation plus eco sensitivity... combined with great surf and house reef, Heaven for kids with 5 star spa and luxury for mums! "
"We stayed at six senses for a week in an over water villa. The villa itself is amazing and innovative with the environment at the heart of the design. The house keeping team do a great job and go the extra mile to ensure your stay is comfortable.   The resort itself is everything I had hoped it would be and more. There is a sense of community on the island amongst staff that, as a guest, you feel immediately a part of which was really nice. I would really recommend doing the heart of the house tour about sustainability. We found it inspiring.   There are lots of activities and excursions to meet any budget. We took advantage of a number of complimentary activities such as the reef clean and the massage workshops. Our workshop leader, Lin was fab.   Snorkelling in the house reef‚Ä¶"
"This is my second time at the resort and I stayed in both Lagoon and Ocean Villa.  Recently, I stayed in Ocean Water Villa which is closed to Yin Yang (Surf Break). High privacy in the location.  Foods are still the best. And don't forget to try the 42 flavors homemade ice cream.  We were able to see spinning dolphins along the way to the picnic island.  SPA is my top favorite. Thank you ""PI"" for giving me the most relaxing massage experience.  And to our GEMS ""CAVEL"" ""MILA"", you two are amazing! Six Senses Laamu Maldives is a must see island resort in the Maldives.  Nature friendly. Hospitable Staffs. Great Ambiance. Superb!"
"A really incredible experience from start to finish. The airport transfers, boat trip, the front of house welcome, all the experiences, food and staff were fantastic. I really can't say a bad word about anything. Our particular highlights were our Surfing lesson, aerial yoga, turtle hatching and a meal at the LEAF restaurant."
"After staying at great hotels and locations as Cape Grace Hotel (Cape Town), and mostly at Royal Livingstone by Anantara (Victoria Falls), and Dulini Lodge (at Sabi Sands Private Game Reserve), which was really special and amazing, I thought that the last two weeks of our honeymoon, at Six Senses Laamu be just a relax time and not so much more. But in the end this 2 weeks have possibly been the best holidays on in my entire life.   Although it takes some time to arrive from Male to the hotel, first by local flight to Kadhdhoo airport and then bu fast boat, it is completely worthy.  The moment you arrive you are welcome by all of the staff at the arrivals jetty (starting by Marteyne, the Hotel General Manager), the GEMs (Guest Experience Makers and, at the end, your ‚Äúbest‚Ä¶"
"Our travel company recommended Six Senses Laamu to use after listening to our wants and needs. They couldn't have chosen a better resort for us. A fantastic welcome arrival (even in very stormy weather) and our GEM, Najah, made us feel at home straight away with a tour and settling in to the villa. Every single member of staff we encountered was friendly and they couldn't do enough for you.  Our lagoon water villa was perfect for our honeymoon. Pure luxury, stunning views and so many places to relax and unwind. We spent most of our time here and enjoyed the peace and tranquility. The food was amazing and they were more than willing to prepare food that wasn't on the menu for me. We particularly enjoyed the ambience in Leaf Restaurant and wish we had somewhere that special near‚Ä¶"
"We had the most amazing time at Six Senses Laamu. The resort is stunning with it's Robinson Crusoe style and barefoot luxury.   All the staff and our GEM Ali vas very friendly and professional with a high service level at every area. From the airport in Male, throughout your stay at Six Senses, the service is 100%!   A nice poolarea where small kids can also play and a nice kids club with great staff, especially Jovi, that we got to know a bit.   Perfect surf for both advanced and beginners, with great coaches from Tropic surf. Perfect mellow reef break just outside the resort and bigger waves like Yin Yang and Machines, when you go out with a boat from the resort.   Our little boy broke his arm the last day of our vacation and the resort doctor, our GEM Ali, the manager and‚Ä¶"
"I went with my friend in August. From start to finish this was a trip of a lifetime. Everyone is super friendly. We stayed in a family villa with pool and bit of beach. Was breathtaking, everything is beautiful. Our villa was spotless and massive. The outdoor shower was amazing. Getting around the island on a bike was fun. We spent a lot of time at the sip sip bar next to the pool. We even managed to watch a turtle hatching in the middle of the night, waited 3 hours on the beach but it was worth it, that was an experience I will never forget. I would definitely go back and even take my children next time."
This hotel is totally unforgettable. You take off your shoes in the speed boat when you arrive and then you do not use them until you get back to the airport. The water villas are absolutely amazing with many playful details like a glass floor under the bathtub made of glass. Even in the toilet you can watch the fish through the floor:) You get your own bike with personal number plate and that is the way you move around the island. Food is really good and several restaurants to choose from. 42 flavors of home made ice cream in the lounge FOC and movies under the stars at night.  And not forgetting the incredible marine life. A better eco orientation than I ever seen. Everything is recycled like glass bottles and towels and made into tables and vases. They even have in-house‚Ä¶
"We stayed in two types of room, a water villa in Jetty A and a water villa with pool in Jetty C. Both of the views are great. Jetty A offers great access to swim or snorkel, while Jetty C offers great view to the ocean.  It was an unforgettable experience to snorkel and swam in the boundless pool. We spent most of our time in the room, doing water activities or just relaxed with the ocean views. In clear nights, there are countless stars on the sky. The restaurants were all excellent and offer a variety of food with culinary expertise. We tasted Japanese food in Zen, Mediterranean style in Longitude and creative cuisine in Leaf. Also, we went to the complimentary ice cream station with more than 50 kinds of flavor every day. Our GEM, Najah had great arrangements for us every‚Ä¶"
"Our third time at Six Senses Laamu. We always have fantastic time here at Six Senses. GEM will always make sure that you will bring home with the greatest experience. Love this resort and will come back again for sure.  IF YOU'RE LUCKY, from Jetty B, you would see sea turtle in the afternoon, some rays under Jetty B bridge in the morning. From breakfast buffet, you would see dolphins around 7-8ama and rays. And shark reef under the bridge where the buggy pickup-drop off and many more fishes."
"For us Six Sense Laamu is the true definition of oasis! Far from main city, you travel 45minutes by plane few minutes on a speedboat with fresh organic juice being served, courteous boat crews. The staff made our holiday flawless, we didn‚Äôt worry of anything. Our kids too had fantastic days in the kids club run by Jovy, she gave us the opportunity to relax knowing the little ones were well taken care of, they never got bored and excited to come back every day. Breakfast is an experience. The best service we had in the restaurants, very friendly and professional. Only the spa prices a bit too high but treatments we had were amazing. We really want to come back."
"Excellent short break. Staff where excellent especially Sato our Guest Experience Manager, nothing was too much trouble. The resort is beautiful and the standard of cooking along with the service in each of the restaurants is second to none. The free ice cream/sorbet is also a nice gesture which we samples each day. Would highly recommend and we are looking forward to going back in the future."
"From the moment we arrived on the boat after our very long journey, we started to relax. This is the place of dreams and the staff are so genuinely helpful and happy. My husbands highlight was surfing two breaks and tropic surf were super helpful in where and when would be the best places to go bodyboarding. My highlight was seeing spinner dolphins in the atoll on the sunset cruise - it delivered on both counts.  We saw green turtles every day from our lagoon water villa and the snorkelling around the island when it was calm was wonderful - we saw turtles, rays, reef sharks and an abundance of reef fish - including unicorn and parrot fish. We grew very fond of the trumpet fish who happily swim around the island and villas.  The food was wonderful and the staff catered for both‚Ä¶"

"In all my years of travelling, I have yet to ever write a review, so the very fact that I am should indicate how strongly I feel about this particular resort. EVERY single element of our trip from the minute we arrived at Male International Airport was 5 star‚Ä¶. We were met at Male Airport by a representative from Six Senses who collected us and our luggage and escorted us to the domestic airport and put us on our internal flight to Khadoo, where we were met by another Six Senses rep who then escorted us on to the boat for the 15 minute ride to Laamu, or should I say, Paradise. As the boat approached the landing dock, we could see an array of people waiting to welcome us ‚Äì it turned out that all the resort heads of departments were there including the wonderful Resort Manager,‚Ä¶"
"Imagem Paradise...  Hard to review Paradise...is it all perfect, no. But it certainly comes very close to perfection. The villas are absolutely amazing - not even Hollywood could make a set look similar. Service is is out flaws and each villa has it own concierge  and they take care of everything!   Several restaurants, all delicious. Serving from burgers and pizzas, japoneses, french cousine, Vietnamese and local Maldivian. All very tasty and well served.  Several additional excursions, but for a scuba diver as me, this is mandatory. Six Sense is privileged to have manta cleaning station 10 mins from the hotel and a super non-profit doing incredible research and preservation. So in addition to reefs with multitude of fish, turtles and sharks, you have the unique and privileged‚Ä¶"
"Fourth time at Six Senses Laamu, and it is always a repeated success in terms of location, staff, food, general ambiance plus some of the best scuba diving on this planet :) Looking forward to the fifth !"
"The whole family enjoyed an amazing 6 nights at Six Senses Laamu. This island for us is the ultimate place to stay if you dream of a magical holiday in Maldives.   I wont ever forget the breathtaking views, rustic-chic villas overwater, exclusive dinner experience and the connection with nature-barefoot policy and the jungle that surrounds the island, all just now!  The highlight was the service, topnotch! Our gem was ever helpful and alwaysvready to give our requests.  We love Jovi and her team in the kids club. My son never falter to join the activities everyday.   Food was superb, spa is a must-try. We absolutely loved this place, we will definitely going back!"
"We stayed for 11 nights in two water villas on Jetty A during July 2018. Everything was perfect - place, food, service. Heaven on earth. We had half board with breakfast and dinner in all restaurants, which was perfect as we just supplemented with light lunch between two big meals. Six Senses has a perfect mix between total luxury and total relaxation, we went barefoot the whole time. Has to be experienced!"
"The best resort we have ever been at....the staff, the food, the jetty, their way of thinking recycling and earth lab.... just to mention a few üòä just love the place and want to come back And ud you bring children their kids club had good activities and a dedicated staff"
"Maldives Six Senses is the purest essence to wake up your senses  Harmonising with the natural world, Six Senses nestles & blends amonsgt lush tropical flora, crystal clear turquoise ocean & ‚Äòpeace‚Äô. Nothing has not been thought of to ensure guests are more than adequately accommodated as you submerge in paradisic blissful luxury "
"I have traveled a lot and been to many resorts with Spa but this was something beyond the usual. So impressed that Six Sense concepts start before arrival and ending until you're home again. Impressive concept.  Down to earth - This means that when you're in the boat heading to the island, you take off shoes and stockings and are barefoot the rest of your time on the island. The shoes come first when you go home. Wonderfully. (optional)  When we arrive, the staff is on the bridge and welcome you.  On my way to my villa, I meet people who all greet with a happy hello.  Outside the house is your own bike waiting. My house is on the beach with the sea as a neighbor. Two outdoor showers and a bathtub, two patios and a resting place under the roof of the stars. The house smells good‚Ä¶"
"We stayed 11 days at Six Senses Laamu for our honeymoon and had the most amazing time! The whole island and our water villa were so so beautiful. Being surrounded by turquoise blue water the whole day is just amazing. The food in all the different restaurants was very good. Our highlight was the ""live cooking"" evenings where absolutely delicious dishes were being prepared. The staff was always very friendly. Also, there is an abundance of activities that can be booked from spa treatments to sunset cruises, which we enjoyed very much.  My absolute highlight, however, was going diving. I had never tried it before, but booked a beginners course with the Deep Blue Divers team. Although I was nervous before my first dive, the underwater world impressed me so much during my first dive‚Ä¶"
From the very beginning we were blown away by the customer service. Arriving at the Male airport by boat from another resort (Banyan Tree) we were greeting by a gentleman from Six Senses. He escorted us through the airport to the check in lounge were he took care of everything while we sat up stairs in the lounge. Which was a life saver traveling with kids.   The flight was short and when we arrived we were again greeted by a fleet of staff who took care of us until we boarded the boat to Laamu.   They employee a philosophy of ‚Äú barefoot luxury‚Äù which to start with sounded odd but upon arrival makes perfect sense.   The over water bungalow was immaculate as is the entire resort. The attention to detail is second to none. You are introduced to your ‚ÄúGEM‚Äù who takes care of you the‚Ä¶
"Two years ago my husband surprised me with a weeks holiday to Six Senses Laamu that was on my 'dream list' to visit. Since my return I was telling my friends about it how amazing everything was and when the right time came to celebrate my friends birthday, we decided to book a week as a special treat.   The Maldives is mainly a honeymoon destination and firstly we thought that we may get bored as two girls traveling together, but we did not have to worry.  Our week at Six Senses Laamu was perfect. From our arrival to departure, we felt like a royalty. Our Gem (Auzam) was a star!   Everybody was so friendly to us so it is difficult to mention all but I especially want to thank Riza and Sharwaan - from Longitude restaurant who looked after us so well.

This place is the definition of natural beauty at its finest. We are in awe of this place and have a huge amount of respect for what Six Senses stand for! The sustainability and eco friendly efforts they evolve their resorts around is outstanding. It‚Äôs a pure example in what all of us can do if we all put our minds to it! The nature surrounding the island was breathtaking. We have never gone to a location where we truly felt deeply connected in both its values and respect for wildlife until we came here. It was really hard to leave- it‚Äôs pure paradise! To top everything off the staff were impeccable! Every single staff member we encountered was a pleasure to speak to! Outstanding service from every level! We can not thank you enough for making our honeymoon the most beautiful‚Ä¶
"This started out as a boy's surf trip, the first overseas surfing holiday my 12-year-old son and I would share. Somewhere along the way, my wife and daughter saw the website and decided they were coming. It turned out to be the ideal place for all of us to spend time together as a family. My son and I surfed twice a day, with the help of expert surf guides and boat rides out to the best breach day. The girls snorkelled, had massages and facials, swum and read books. Our toughest choice each day was which one of four restaurants to dine at. The service and food was amazing at all of them. The Six Senses staff are amazing and make you feel welcome from the moment you arrive at the little airstrip. The attention to detail and facilities are incredible. I couldn't fault anything‚Ä¶"
"So much to say about Six Senses and our stay is not over yet but I wanted to capture the magic of the resort, the amazing team that makes you feel one in a billion  From the moment we landed we were placed at the centre of what the team at the hotel do, and they made our 21.5 hour travel to the resort melt away into a distant memory. From the gems we were introduced to, to the greeting by the hotel manager you felt from day one this was all about your experience, mind, body and soul.  It‚Äôs easy to get over emotional about the experience we are still Enjoying but they really put you at the centre of what they do. Whether you part take in all the activates or simply come to chill.  We loved the massages and enjoyed watching the sun set from our villa.  We took part in a weekly‚Ä¶"
"We stayed for 9 days which we were concerned might be too long; but our family had the most relaxing stay while never getting bored.  Afro was a excellent butler with our kids, food/service were excellent"
"Everything is so good from the moment you arrive until departure. This is one of the very unique places I've been to in the Maldives. out of everything I experienced, their food and how it is displayed, how you have to explore the buffet area on a huge overwater structure is such a cool experience."
"Generally good food and good service. Activities are expensive and quite limited, as in lots of restrictive rules, for example kayaking is only really allowed in front of the rental place, only after begging for it we were allowed to go around the island and to the sandbank.  The staff is nice, but the GEM and general management seems not genuinely enthusiastic. The friendliness came across to us like a smile that's there because we paid for it.  When you arrive you have a 'personal butler' called the guest experience maker (GEM). He was our main point of contact to make arrangements for any activity we'd like to do or questions we might have.  He introduced us to our room at the end of jetty A with a 100% sunset guarantee according to our GEM. What about clouds? Will it never‚Ä¶"
"Hey, I‚Äôm here to tell of u that this hotel is the best hotel I have ever been to, so I actually recommend it to you. Have a nice time in the hotel, because it‚Äôs not cheaper and it‚Äôs probably your last time there.  Hola! Estoy aqu√≠ para deciros que este hotel  es el mejor en que yo he estado, y os lo recomiendo. Tened unos buenos momentos en el hotel, porque no es baratos y puedes que sea la √∫nica vez que est√©is all√≠,"
"Came here for 5 days. Whilst it certainly isn‚Äôt the cheapest, the standard of service and food was high. We had an overwater lagoon villa. The snorkelling at the reef metres away from the main restaurant was great with an abundance of fish. The sandbank excursion is a must. Very relaxing chilled out holiday. "
"We were so much in love with the place and the experience that we extended our stay one more night! One of the best customer service experienced, surprisingly tasty and quality food, attention to every detail and... what to say about the rooms! rustic, charming and with every single amenity possible.   The facilities are outstanding and everything is organic and sustainable, 10 out of 10 time there!  One suggestion: free sunscreen in the future, please!"
"I'm writing this review after staying at the Six Senses for five days for my honeymoon. The stay was absolutely incredible and exceeded my expectations! We ate at all of the restaurants (except for the Japanese one) and all of our meals were fantastic. On our last night, we booked the private island BBQ which was so special. The staff were all accommodating and knowledgeable about the resort and the Maldives. We went on two dives and the team were well-informed about the ocean life in the dive sites. My husband also learned how to surf and really enjoyed his lesson. Thank you for making our honeymoon so special!"
"We absolutely loved the Six Senses Laamu! It was the second stop on our Honeymoon. (We stayed at the Four Seasons Kuda Huraa  for the first half, which was also amazing.)   The service was fantastic and the resort was stunning! Seriously picturesque and exactly what you would envision the Maldives to look like. The activities were great, as were the food options. The breakfast buffet was unreal!!! I‚Äôve posted some pictures, but they just don‚Äôt do it justice!!  Room highlights included: -stunning view (I think we had a Sunset Lagoon Villa w/pool - #18 on Jetty A?) - Jetty A is nearest to the main area, which means less walking! You can‚Äôt hear the main area from the end of the Jetty though. The sunset is best viewed from Chill Bar though. -pool was great -outdoor shower was‚Ä¶"
"It was a fantastic experience! Extremely  comfortable rooms, a kitchen constantly surprising us and many activities for wellness in the spa (especially the introduction to the stick mobility system). Another very favorable point was the full availability of GEM ( in our case Mr Arif)."
"Absolutely amazing!  Went here for a surf holiday with my fianc√©e.  We stayed at another resort before this as well which gave us a good base line.  First off I had tore my hamstring surfing at the previous resort and nobody their could do anything.  2 days later I arrived here and the spa has a sports physio on staff who has me out back surfing that day and totally saved my trip!! Richie was an absolute Legend and went far beyond the call of duty for us.  There was other guys who had injuries that were still surfing that otherwise would have had a ruined trip if not for him.  And this was indicative of the service of the rest of the resort that they literally thought of everything!!!  Staff was very friendly and attentive, there‚Äôs all type of complimentary extras, and the food‚Ä¶"

"This is the best holiday my family ever had.  Six Sense is just perfect for everything.  Great resort, warm staff, yummy ice-cream, great snorkeling experience and the swimming pool was the place my little one spent most of the day.  My little boy said ""mommy, I want to stay here at least 110 days"" (110 so far is the biggest number he knew).  I believe he loved all the friendly staff, ice cream, blue sky, lovely beach and the most exciting thing was the snorkeling experience he had with the coach Abdulla Majeed.  Special thanks to Abdulla who had made sure the safety while bring the excitement."
This resort is the best place I stayed in my life ‚ù§Ô∏è  The staffs are very friendly and helpful.  Is just a little far from the capital but when you arrive is totally worth   I did many activities they are so good   The scuba diving instructor are so helpful and friendly   I would highly recommend this place  Can‚Äôt wait to come back ‚ù§Ô∏è
"Great resort, accomodated all our needs, active, perfect surf , diving, gym and total relaxation. So much variety of food to choose from, All restraunts are superb, great variety for breakfast. Could not fault the staff. Tropisurf guides were top class , safety first and great company. Nice snorkeling at villas and in front of main resort.Great dreamy stay, thanks guys"
This is my 3rd time here. Very warm welcome with the best service and hospitality. Arif(my GEMS) can arrange everything for me perfectly every single time. All staff is nice and friendly. Spa is amazing. The food is great. Can't wait to go back again.
"Honestly one of The best hotels I‚Äòve ever been to. No complains! I recommend the pool Villa, it‚Äôs just amazing to watch The Sun set while swimming and after that go to an amazing Dinner in one of The Restaurants! Will definitley come back :)"
"Having been to 4 other six senses resorts we had high expectations and we loved six senses laamu so much that after a week there we decided to stay additional 4 nights.End of May/june is supposed to be low seasosn but we were very lucky with weather, there were tropical downpours for quite a few nights but only 2 out of 12 days we saw rain during a day. It was very windy though which was actually good as it didnt feel too hot and humid. Our overwater villa was beautiful in shabby chic way. We coud see mantas and turtles from our deck( especially early morning and evening) . We were on jetty ! And apperantly turtles love to feed on seagrass. Our daughter loved kids club. lala was very sweet and always came up with various activities for kids.  The marine biologists are‚Ä¶"
"everything is simply fantastic, perfect and excellent ... extraordinary staff...the heavenly place...delicious food, wonderful over water, full of every comfort...everyone should stay there at least once in their life"
"I went to Six Senses Laamu alone. They made me feel with the whole world! I have had an immediately contact to nature thanks to the GEM (my genius was Auzam, i loved him). I have had also a wonderful experience with the undersea world (what a world) thanks to the magnificent diving (Danny, my instructor and friend, above all). You have to try it, alone or with someone you love, come on!  Best, Paola "
"The whole experience was fantastic!   We were met by a six senses rep at Male Airport who helped us check-in for a local flight and then a power boat ride to the resort. On arrival, we were greeted by the General manager and reps from the different departmental teams, we thought that was a lovely personal touch and that was just the beginning. We were also introduced to our GEM, who was exceedingly helpful and definitely helped to 'personalise' our stay. The resort was as in the brochure:  - pristine beaches, uncluttered by people;  - our ocean villa was luxurious, fully furnished with TV and Bose music system, great patio/outdoor dining area and outdoor bathroom with shower and bath; easy access to the house reef from the patio, rays and turtles as well as regular visitors of‚Ä¶"
"This is our 16th anniversary trip. Laamu is so perfect. We appreciate Ms.Marteyne give us special arrangement and several activities. And All the staffs are so nice especially Lili, Afra, Trevor, Mila, Megan, Steven. We did snorkeling several times and saw turtles and a lot of kinds of fishes. The back of house is so funny. The SPA is classic. The food is so amazing especially leaf restaurant. When our unicorn run away, I called Afra. He arranged the speedboat quickly to catch it back. We hope to come Laamu again next year."
"My wife Angela and I went to Maldives Six Senses Laamu last week and had an excellent 4-night holiday there. This is our first time staying in Six Senses Hotel and the facilities and services are so impressive. Firstly, we‚Äôd like to thank Ms. Marteyne for upgrading our rooms, so that we can experience both beach villa and water villa. The villas are huge and with very good facilities, as well as good privacy. Also the food is so amazing, there are many options clients can choose, Japanese food, Vietnam food, Organic food, beach BBQ, at least 5 restaurants to choose. The food is delicious and fresh, and very fits Chinese clients‚Äô needs. Various activities are provided to clients, including many complimentary water sports activities, snorkeling, diving, sunset dolphin cruise,‚Ä¶"
"Amazing 25th anniversary trip.  Came all the way from California and it was worth every penny.  Enjoyed snorkelling, diving, swimming, paddle boards, kayaks, massage, wining, dining, pool bar cocktails and games, sunrises, sunsets and just chilling in the over water villa!  Have never been any place as beautiful. above and below water!"
We had the most incredible time. The island is utter paradise!  The villas are amazing and everything you could ever hope for. The food is to die for. The cocktails are exceptional - and all in all we didn't want to leave.   This was my second visit to Laamu and it certainly won't be my last!
"Simply, the best holiday I have ever been on in my entire life.   I don't even know where to start, as everything was perfect from our welcome by all of the staff, to the moment with left with all of the staff waving us off goodbye. I LOVED EVERY SINGLE SECOND (except leaving). Therefore, I shall keep it short and sweet.  The hotel staff were all so beautiful and kind.   The food was organic and fresh from their gardens. The Maldivian curries were beautiful. Also, being dairy/ gluten free I didn't ever struggle at all with options. Even on the buffets for breakfast the chef offered to make me anything that I fancied. Every meal I had was absolutely incredible. I am a nutritional therapist and was in love with the menu. The fresh vegetable juices in the morning were my personal‚Ä¶"
"My wife and me along with our two kids visited for 5 nights in May. We had booked a beach villa and when we reached the property (after a long flight and a fairly choppy speed boat ride in the rain) we were informed that we had been upgraded to family beach villa with pool! Super!   The beach villa was top notch with direct access to the beach (Its a private beach with access only to villa guests) , a huge private pool, 2 bedrooms , and a terrace. The beach was prisitine with unending views of the Indian ocean in multiple hues of blue. Our girls had a fantastic time in the villa exploring all corners and splashing about in the pool daily.   The resort is A-grade, up there with the best resorts in the world.  They have 4 restaurants which are run with a lot of love and care by‚Ä¶"
"In May,  my wife and I went to Maldives via Singapore for a short vacation.  We hoped to stay in a secluded resort with comfortable and un-restrictive view water villas. After some extensive browsing and comparison before the trip, we decided to settle at the Six Senses Laamu.   The few days that we were staying at the Six Senses Laamu, we were greatly pampered by the wonderful hospitality and thoughtful arrangements offered during our stay. The Resort was well fitted with different types of activities and water sports. The one thing that we enjoyed the most was doing snorkelling and watching the different water life amongst the corals which was just about 50m away from the bars and dining area of the resort. The resort also provided free guided snorkelling tour led by its‚Ä¶"
"Thank you once again for a memorable holiday experience at SSL. This is our 5th trip to the Maldives and 2nd visit to Six Senses Laamu and we can‚Äôt wait to go back. The domestic flight and speed boat transfer to and from the resort went very smoothly. We stayed in an ocean villa where we spent most of our time snorkelling and exploring the extensive house reef which is breathtaking.  We have two children 7 & 9 years old who loved the snorkelling because it was an easy swim from our villa to the house reef and they were overwhelmed with the abundant marine life, which included reef sharks, green turtles and eagle rays. The scuba diving excursions were also fantastic. The food, service and rooms are exceptional. What sets it apart from other resorts we've visited in the Maldives‚Ä¶"
"We stayed for five nights in late April and had an amazing experience. The resort is super luxurious, nothing we have ever stayed at before even compares. We booked through luxury escapes and had an Ocean water Villa. The room was just out of  this world and the service at the resort was brilliant throughout, from our GEM Alex who was always on call, even at 11pm when one of the neighbouring villas decided to blast music, Alex sorted this out. The wait staff were always attentive and friendly and remembered my partner was a vegetarian. The lady at the ice cream parlour was super nice and funny in a dry humour which we loved and the room was always serviced to a good condition each day. The food was 5 star quality at all the restaurants, so naturally we ate so much! We got to try‚Ä¶"
"We stayed here last week for our 30th anniversary. It was just a perfect week. The location, staff, activities, food and general ambience of the resort was the best that we have experienced.  Had plenty of relaxation time but also spent time each day snorkelling in the Indian Ocean with the magnificent tropical fish and turtles. This experience made our holiday."
"The food, service and rooms were all magnificent but have a few minor complaints: - I don't understand why anyone would want to bring their children here.  We have travelled extensively with our 3 children (teenagers now) and would never consider taking them to a resort such as this.  It's not a child friendly location - boring for older ones and dangerous for little ones therefore not much fun for parents.  Even though the resort wasn't overrun by children, the peace & quiet was regularly disrupted by screaming children and loud families.   - Don't be sold on the sunset and sunrise view rooms.  The sunrise is non existent (very disappointing when you get up early to see it) and I've seen many better sunsets.   - There aren't any fish swimming around the overwater accommodation.‚Ä¶"
"Myself and my Partner stayed at Six Senses Laamu for seven nights in May 2018. This was one of the best (if not the best) holidays we have been on which was driven by the exceptional Six Senses Laamu hotel. Pros and cons below:  Pros: 1.	GEM: Our GEM was Shifu and she was outstanding. Shifu was available 24/7 and we trusted her to organize our days for us and nothing was ever too much trouble for her. Shifu was very friendly, professional and we could tell she genuinely cared about us and wanted to make our experience the best she could.  2.	Level of service: Across the hotel, every staff member is very friendly and they make the hotel special. They are trained to a very high standard and their attention to detail is very impressive (e.g Izaaz Azziz from the Chill bar was almost‚Ä¶"
"We been there for three times and we love indeed to stay at Six Senses Laamu.  Professional staff and comfortable villas, nice pool area, good looking restaurants, delicious foot, wine, drinks and ice creams. "
"We spent 2 nights in this amazing island for site inspection. It was such a happy and memorable occasion for me personally as well as for our team. we stayed in Laamu water villa with pool, lagoon water villa and family beach villa with pool. Warm welcome from the jetty on our arrival.Room, food, service and environment is like second to none. Woke up in the early morning to watch the perfect sunrise and riding the bike to enjoy the intoxicating sunset. What I love the most is people's smile there, it makes me feel so comfort everywhere I went in this island."
"thanks to all Six Senses Laamu team, it was the best holidays, the villa, restaurants, the beach, all the activities,.. all was perfect. Our water lagoon villa was amazing. We hope we can repeat as soon as possible. "
"I travelled to Six Senses Laamu for the second time in 7mths. I really do love it here. We were greeted with hugs on the jetty on arrival and a big welcome back. Everything is just perfect. The service from the staff here is second to none, and we were wonderfully looked after by our gem Ashfag for our entire stay. We requested Ash for a second time as he was so good , and really understood the kinds of things that we love on holiday. Everyone is so friendly. Mina arranged a dolphin Cruise for our stay, which was absolutely breath taking, as we saw all the spinner dolphins at sunset and took amazing pictures. Chef Nadeem prepared us one of his beautifully creative dishes again. We were always excited to see what wonderful things he would create each day. I loved breakfast time,‚Ä¶"
"I traveled with my partner, daughter and her husband who left from Denmark. We flew from Oslo and all met up in Dubai before the onward journey to Mal√©  and our final destination We had some idea of what to expect since my daughter had been in the Maldives twice before, but nothing could have prepared us for our stay in this paradise. The moment the crew welcome you onboard the final leg in the speedboat you already get a sense of service of the highest quality.   We were welcomed personally by the General Manager and her team (after a few days we heard on more than one occasion from her own staff that she is in no small way responsible for making this such an incredible experience.) We were then introduced to Carel our personal Gem (management guide) who ensured we had the most‚Ä¶"
Everything here is paradise and with extra charm - this is the best holiday I have ever had. Beautiful place - incredible Villas - magnifique food - best breakfast in the world - i cannot say enough how good it is. You will not be dissapointed to go there and it is worth every penny. Free Ice-cream all day long - 50 fantastic flavors. Good snorkling - lots of sea turtles and very close to the reef from the chill bar.  Everyone on the island has a bike and this is a cool experience to bike around everyday on the small charming paths.   My best recommendations for this place.   One thing that has nothing to do with the hotel is the transfer - you have to take a domestic flight out the island and the cafeterias you have to wait is really bad - and we waited for 3 hours Also the‚Ä¶
"I am embarrassed to say that I never got around to finishing my review of Six Senses Laamu.  This in NO WAY means we had a negative experience.  In fact this was hands down our most wonderful vacation ever and we have traveled a fair amount.  We went to Six Senses in November 2014 to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary and renew our vows.  We planned on returning for our 25th, but we just couldn't wait any longer and are going back this year for our 24th!!!  So I figured I would go ahead and finish my review...  In the process of deciding where to go for our 20th anniversary, we discovered the  overwater bunglaow resorts of the Maldives.  Even though overwater bungalows in the  South Pacific are much closer to our home in California, we were intrigued by the Maldives and Six‚Ä¶"
"Incredible property with top class service throughout. Excellent food,staff, facilities and a true getaway paradise.  The dream location for any diving or surfing enthusiasts and the perfect location for anyone looking for a remote paradise! Suits couples, families or friends!"
We stayed for 8 blissful night in late April in an over water villa.  The villa and resort was just spectacular. Food was amazing. I have a 4 and 6 year old and they both loved kids club. My major complaint about this resort is that outside of your room you have to pay for drinking water at a cost of about $6 US per bottle which is desalinated sea water! It‚Äôs hot and with 2 kids this becomes quite an expense - you even have to pay for it when you are buying alcohol which is very expensive on the island. I would rather they incorporate a water cost into your accommodation fee as it just feels so miserable and something that I have not encountered at any luxury resort I have stayed at. On a whole great resort though!
"Amazing.  Great staff, great location, great customer service, great attention to detail... all in all a sensational experience.  The highlight for us was the diving organised by Deep Blue Divers.  Our dive master Danilo Bellese was excellent.  He was knowledgeable, skilled, patient and a great advocate for marine conservation.  The dive centre equipment was in excellent condition and the dive boat staff were also great - it was an amazing experience.  Cannot recommend Dani or the Deep Blue Divers highly enough.  Can't wait until we return!"
"With the Six senses brand, an Eco chic luxury resort in the Maldives. Visited with my partner, we loved the sustainability, bicycles and no shoes approach to the resort. We took the half board option, make's it easier to not think about dinner and the pricing.  Beautiful atoll. Soft white sand. You can walk around it with ease. Crystal clear water with a lot of marine life. You are really taken to paradise.   If you can take the sunset and dolphin cruise. There were many highlights of our stay and this was definitely one of them. Watching the sunset with canap√©s, drinks.. and to add dolphins swimming around.  - Large villas / rooms. Outdoor showers. We had direct access to the sea. Extremely inviting. Remember to get the fins and the snorkeling gear from the dive center. - A‚Ä¶"
"We just spent 7 nights with our 6 yo daughter. 5 nights beach villa with pool, 2 nights water villa with pool. Great atmosphere, staff very efficient and very nice, food is amazing. Our little one enjoy the kids club very much. Villas & views are breathtaking. Even guests are nice and friendly! Looking forward to coming back soon."
"We selected Six Senses for its unique philosophy. Lamuu is the best place to understand how Six Senses hotels behaves perfectly showing how sustainability, wellness and (re)connection are the keywords today. We loved the island, the villa, the staff, the scuba diving center (the best I have ever seen), the ice-cream parlor and the absolutely non-mistakable trip to Picnic island. We will post an incredible video on our Instagram Gillesetboissier. Congratulations to Marteyn, the GM, the fairy of the island! D.Boissier/Gilles et Boissier"
"We visited Six Senses Laamu 3 years ago and I wrote a glowing TripAdvisor then. I'm happy to do it again though it won't be as long this time. It lived up to our memories and expectations in every way and even surpassed them. We spent 12 nights here, half in a Water Villa and half in an Ocean Beach Villa for contrast. We preferred the latter, but it's a personal choice. The island is large enough for bicycles to be useful and riding them along the paths is memorable especially in the evening with its evocative vegetation scents. Staying on the island, the snorkelling is magical and accessible from the Sip-Sip beach or the Chill Bar. We thought it better from the beach. The food is fantastic and so much thought goes into planning and cooking it all. Congratulations to the chefs‚Ä¶"
"This is one of the larger islands we have been to, although it was at 90% capacity there was never the feeling of lack of privacy. Beautiful bungalows, my favorite of the 7 resorts I have been to, nice choice of a la carte restaurants and bars, great kids club (my kids wanted to stay every day there), good service, 5 star quality plus. The Maledives are gorgeous and if you are looking for one of the better hotels than you really can't go wrong here, top quality all the way and any minor complaint would be an insult to the energy invested in this wonderful resort under capable management. I would rate the island a 10, food 8, service 9, kids club 9, bungalows 10, main pool 8.  Night entertainment consists of a nice bar on the water and open air cinema, no dancing or clublife. ‚Ä¶"

Pictures just don't do it justice, it's a must visit destination.  Then there is Six Senses. What can we say, nothing short of perfection.  We have travelled extensively however this was our first stay in a Six Senses resort.  It is a 10 star experience.  We stayed in an overwater villa on jetty c which faces the surf break.

"We spent a week in an overwater villa on jetty A mid April and had a fantastic time. The staff were warm and friendly and our GEM, Satho, was so helpful. The water was beautiful and clear with reef and fish so close to the Chill bar. We spent almost every day snorkeling. The food was great with 5 different restaurants/bars to chose from. There was an additional service charge and tax resulting in an extra 22% on top of the advertised food and salon prices that we weren‚Äôt aware of prior to going. Maybe it would have been more cost effective to go 1/2 or full board so all meals were included, which we didn‚Äôt do.

"It was a long journey from Bray (UK) (via Colombo, on Sri Lankan Airlines) to the idyllic Six Senses Laamu resort but it was very much worth it and my only real complaint is that we did not stay long enough! This was our second visit to the Maldives and, having previously stayed at the two Four Seasons resorts, expectations were high and I am really pleased to say that the affable team at Six Senses delivered! The resort was somewhat larger than we imagined it would be but with bicycles provided that was not an issue. In addition a buggy service is available and your personal GEM (Guest Experience Maker) is available 24/7 to help ensure you have a perfect stay.

Six Senses Laamu Resort did not fail to deliver!!!  The cliche: it's is worth the long trip speaks true to this paradise.  The view that welcomed us is something beyond description.  The idea of  glass floors inside the bathroom villa and the thought that you sleep afloat the crystal waters is just one of a kind.  The warmth and hospitality of the resort staff made our stay even more special.  Our GEM Ashfag  was very courteous and he made sure that all our needs were well attended  to.

We stayed here for a week for our honeymoon after being referred by a repeat visitor and now we know why! The place is amazing and the customer service is above and beyond!

And if you snorkel between jetty A and B you may see a green turtle munching on the sea grass - we saw two and a giant sting ray!  The bungalow comes with an outdoor shower and glass floor window in the toilet to watch the fishes swim by as you poop.  You get a GEM which is like host who is your main point of contact.

We were absolutely disgusted and so disappointed to leave this paradise in the beautiful Maldives. Having 4 flights and a speedboat transfer could have been a problem but Qatar airways were fabulous. There is nothing to say that has not been said in lengthy reviews but we would in particular like to thank our GEM Naseem who was perfect. Nothing was too much trouble and he delivered superlative service.His English was crystal clear and we could not have asked for anyone better. The yoga kept us all in tip top condition and our Tibetan guru Kunchok was outstanding. This was our first visit to a Six Senses resort and as Aman junkies we felt it was on a similar level...and that is a huge compliment. We look forward very much to visiting other resorts..Zighy Bay in Oman may be next.‚Ä¶
"Stayed for 8 nights with our 7 month old and 4.5 year old in a Family Beach Villa. There's a small second bedroom for children. The bed is definitely for children as it's not long enough for adults!

The room was extremely kid friendly - when we arrived, the cot was set up with it's own mosquito netting (and when we moved the cot into the second bedroom, the mosquito netting was moved as well), bottle warmer, steriliser, changing mat, high chair, baby bath.

"So what‚Äôs the difference between a great resort and an outstanding one?    Like all great resorts, SS Laamu has fantastic facilities.  Terrific water villas in a magical setting, superb restaurants (our favourite is Leaf) and a huge range of activities for all of the family.  Life‚Äôs day to day experiences are incredible as well.  Cycling to breakfast sounds so simple but it becomes so special as you cycle down the jetty trying to decide whether to look at the beauty of the island or to look down to spot a ray or a turtle (we saw both). It‚Äôs also a very cleverly designed resort, it always seems so peaceful and quiet despite it being full over the Easter holidays.    Laamu isn‚Äôt just great though, we think it‚Äôs outstanding.

"I've been hesitating to write this review because then I actually have to admit to myself that our glorious holiday is over.  We spent a week at Six Senses Laamu during our kids' spring break, and it exceeded our expectations.  We wanted a luxurious holiday that was family friendly, without feeling like we were at ""family friendly"" resort, if you know what I mean.  Six Senses Laamu ticked all the boxes.  Our top 3 criteria for choosing this wonderful resort were as follows: 1) Kids club: there is so much for the children to do!  Every day the schedule was full with a variety of activities to choose from.  Jelyn, Lala, Mizna, and the other staff took such thoughtful care of our girls.  There was even a special appearance by the Easter bunny, much to their delight. 2) House reef:‚Ä¶"
I cannot recommend this resort highly enough. The staff was amazingly friendly and helpful. The food is excellent from breakfast to lunch and dinner.  Our only problem with most maldives islands were the beach bites...insects? So bring a good itch cream!

The property (especially the Spa) were truly world class in terms of food, service, relaxation and excursions.  Our butler Naseem ensured we knew what was going on around the property, and helped us create an itinerary to fit our desires.  WHat we will remember most is the spa and the food. Dr Gopal literally changed our lives as it was our first encounter with certain ancient easter world medicines and both my wife and I found the experimentations very helpful. We reset our diets with wonderful and healthy food, got rest and relaxed while scuba diving, dining, and also some great snorkeling.

We stayed in over the water bungalow number 69 and must I say, I was like a kid in a candy store...the WOW factor is nothing short of that. From the see through bathtub, to the open water shower and see through floor in the toilet...

"Enjoyed it so much last year we had to bring our daughter. It is the most amazing place to go on holiday. From the moment you are met in Male airport then by the boat crew you are aware that this is a special place. The Maldives is a wonderful place but the team at Six Senses are fantastic. No doubt the whole hotel is led well but every member of staff is on message! Fantastic villas, wonderful beach, great food. Simply amazing! Our GEM Sato was great (again) but a special word for Dino and Des too! Hope to go back soon. You should too!"
"We recently (March 2018) spent a week at Six Sense Laamu with our two children, aged 6 and 3.  The experience was extraordinary. The quality of the place and its people is amazing. Beautiful landscapes, delicious food, brilliant menu of activities, great villa. A perfect blend of peace and action in an unforgettable atmosphere.  We had a GEM-Guest Experience Maker (named ""Nayah"") with us most of the time who made every effort to make our stay unique. He was superb and so caring with our boys. I would strongly recommend this experience to anyone wishing to stay in paradise for a few days."
"From the moment we stepped off the plane in Male we had help from Six Senses. Sato our GEM took such good care of us throughout our stay. Nothing was too much trouble. Sato organised a private kitchen garden tour for us with the chef which was fascinating.  All the hosts welcome you with a smile and are so engaging. The water villa was fantastic . We saw stingrays, sand sharks, turtles and many shoals of fish whilst just looking out from the villa. We thoroughly enjoyed cycling to the restaurants and around the island. We ate in all the restaurants where the quality and presentation of the food was excellent. A trip to the ice cream parlour during the day became a must and it was here that we met and chatted to other guests.We went out on one of the dive boats to snorkel and we‚Ä¶"
"This is the best place you can stay in Maldives. Everything was perfect. Villa, food, staff, design, free ice cream, tours, coral reefs, snorkling, meet-the-management evenings, views, spa & treatments. We know a lot of people who have stayed here and other places in Maldives. All says Six Senses Laamu is Second to None!!!"
"My husband and I are the type of couple who would really save up for a best vacation experience. Six Senses Laamu never failed to deliver! The wonderful feeling of being in paradise in every corner of the resort.  We were billeted in Jetty C, and Ali was the ever helpful staff who made our stay hassle free. He was very attentive to our needs and simple requests. Same as other staff all over the resort. Props for hiw they were trained to handle guests like us!!!   The room is truly amazing, with the view and all. The food experience is superb. The amenities and the theme really blend w with nature.   Six Senses is truly a gem of Laamu!!! Keep up the good work. Truly looking forward to our next stay with friends as we proudly shared to them our unforgettable experience"
"From the moment we landed ( its a very small airport), we were welcomed with smiles and good taking care. Walked a bit until the boat (around 30 min ride- cold towels for refreshing and tasty lemonades were handled), then at our arrival at the hotel some of the staff were welcoming us (managers, gems and chefs,etc). After a short introduction we were accompanied by our gem (guest experience maker) naseem/nasim to our villa (19), which is the last villa on the first pontoon(I forgot how they call it). The villa was perfect! Being the last on the right side of the pontoon, we could have even more privacy and bigger view, though it was quite windy, but good, we couldn‚Äôt feel the burning sun :))) ( tip: use 50 spf protection and don‚Äôt sunbathe from 12-14... it will help you not to‚Ä¶"
"Had the most amazing time here. From getting off the plane onwards, we were totally taken care of. The food was excellent. Service was fantastic. Our GEM Abdullah made our entire stay seamless and even sorted out the fact that our luggage didn‚Äôt make it through the connecting flight. We definitely intend to rerun"
"This is my first EVER review of any place where we have stayed. Amazing places, horrible places, you name it. Just never get around to it. I feel obliged to write, because of how remarkable my wife and my experience was at Six Senses. We had the highest expectations based on what we had heard. And somehow this place far exceeded them.  First - do not worry about the extra flight and sea boat from Male. Felt like nothing. From the moment we were met in the Male airport for our transfer to Khadoo by a Six Senses representative, we were treated like a king and queen. After our flight landed in Khadoo, we were met by the six senses speed boat transfer reps who gave us a bag for our shoes (the last time we had anything on our feet for the next 7 days), a great smelling cold,‚Ä¶"
"The place, the food and the hospitality service experience are superb, it's exceeds my expectations. The guest journey was totally awesome from the time you board in their yatch going to the island, wi-fi on board and the combination of local touch & wellness was there to start with. Upon arrival, a welcome from the GEM Team met us to ensure our best stay. The variety of good food in Longitude Resto both breakfast & dinner are awesome. Hisham, Queenie, Jun, Trevo & Moosa are on their exceptional service. The Best Place with Great Food and Great Service made my stay memorable in Maldives."
"The title I got from the travel agency, and it fits perfect.  Six Senses is uncompareable ! (My first visit to the Maldives üôÉ) But anyway - you are picked up at the local airport, walk 500m and board the speedboat. During the trip you are welcomed with a drink, and a bag for your shoes. The rest of the holiday is bare foot - if you are game üòâ Six Senses Laamu is so great fir relaxatiob, snorkling or just being together.  We live in a Water villa (incl bikes) and enjoyed the ride to the restaurants for some of the meals.  We also enjoyed the open-air cinema, the invited expert on the sky/Mars - and the fishes in the sea around us.  You think you get bored - but leave without completing your ideas üòâ  Six Senses should have 10* üèñ‚õ± "
"This review is a little late as we travelled to this resort in October last year for our second visit but hopefully not our last. The mere fact that it is quite a trek to get to this resort (an internal flight from Male followed by a speedboat ride) only adds to the feeling of peace and isolation when you are there. I have been to other resorts in the Maldives where you are very conscious of neighbouring resorts within a stone's throw away, here there is nothing of the kind, just the comings and goings of a couple of inhabited islands to pass the time. We stayed in a sunrise facing water villa on Jetty A which suited us perfectly. This is over the most beautiful part of the lagoon and since our last visit sea grass has been introduced to parts of the sea bed between jetty A and‚Ä¶"
"Excellent honeymoon experience! Sato our GEM is still a topic of conversation two months later. We are a New York City couple who eat at Michelin star restaurants, we can honestly say the food here was much better then any other resort we have been too! "
"Having stayed at various other Six Senses Resorts before, our expectations for Laamu were high. And in a nutshell, they were met again thanks to the beauty of the island, the dedication of the staff and the unique Six Senses unpretentious ""let your hair down"" touch and feel (with the last two being real differentiators compared to the many other luxury resorts in our experience).  Although we hardly stay in one resort more than once (there is so much else to explore), Soneva Fushi being the only exception so far in 20+ years, we would certainly consider going back to Laamu in the future.  For those, who prefer a beach villa as opposed to a water villa (like us), we recommend villas 89 - 94, which enjoy the best stretch of beach, access to the sea and privacy around the island.  ‚Ä¶"
"We went there for a week.  I dare say that it has probably been one of our most relaxing vacations ever.  The hotel was quite full but I only know this because I asked.  Nothing was ever too full or crowded probably because the water villas are so fantastic that you don't want to leave the room. The hotel has a great vibe.  The staff is incredibly friendly and service oriented.  The lady who took the room service orders was simply outstanding!  How many times have you ordered breakfast over the phone and had the lady telling you that she knows you are leaving tomorrow and hopes that you have enjoyed your stay, etc.  We hadn't even met her but she spoke to me over the phone as if we had been regular guests for the last 10 years.  Outstanding. One glitch.  The villas with pool‚Ä¶"
"Just back from an amazing week at six senses Laamu. We were a little unlucky with the weather for a couple of days but it didn‚Äôt matter - this place is so relaxing and beautiful. Went diving for the first time ever (thanks to Hassan for being a great teacher). So many staff worthy of a special mention - our GEM Afrak, the guys at the bar Maduka, Linu, Trevor, Abu, the guys in the restaurant Jaslam, and Shonan, I could go on and on. Staff morale seems very high which is a big reflection of the success of the management. Franz was in charge while we were there and runs a very tight ship whilst maintaining a relaxed happy atmosphere. We stayed in a Laamu water villa which was stunning, really spacious, and we loved the outdoor bathroom. Cannot end this review without mentioning the‚Ä¶"
"After a super busy few months at work all we wanted was a really quiet, very beautiful place to relax and unwind. We knew from our last stay in the Maldives that these islands our pretty perfect and since we last stayed in the northern atolls (JA Manafaru - also great), we decided to try something further south.  Six Senses was really terrific - we loved the beautiful ocean, we loved not wearing any shoes the whole week (except to the gym), we loved having bikes to ride around on everywhere we went, and we loved the ice cream!  A few of the most important things for us and some considerations: - The beaches: really beautiful. Nice to swim on the opposite side of the island of where the jetties are placed, in front of the water sports ctr. The water is calmer on this side and‚Ä¶"
Beautiful small all exclusieve island. Realy heaven on earth. Best of the best! You have to bring Some money but it is worth Every penny. Hospitality as it is supposed to be. Very friendly people and staf
"We just got back from six senses where we chose to spend our Chinese New Year. While it was Peak Season, we didn't feel it was full. The Resort is pretty big and spacious.  The Staff is top notch, our GEM Kokko took care of us and was able to assist in anything we needed. They even so kindly offered us late check out as our flight was late during the day.  Food at the restaurant is good, can't say is the best I have ever had except for the breakfast which was amazing. The Service At The Restaurants are pretty slow though but the staff again was super kind.  What We Really Enjoyed As Well Is The Fact That everywhere we went on the island was with our own bike. Kids Got Their Own As Well And Could Go Anywhere They Wanted as it was so safe. From sip sip the main pool to get their‚Ä¶"
"Excellent ressort with top level service in an underplayed Luxury kind of Way. Lovely and spacious water villa.  Ask for Jetty A when booking, as it has the best location.  The staff is very service minded and makes you feel at home with their accommodating attitude and personal touch towards you as a guest. A special thank to our GEM - Abdullah. Food is very good - but go for a la carte. Buffet also ok - but if you like me like it top notch - then don‚Äôt go there. Prices are up there - but that is to be expected. Free ice cream parlor - pick between 42 flavors - a nice and smart touch by the resort. Now to the small thing - their cutlery/ silverware is awful. It is bought to look good. But has the wrong balance and knives cut like butter knifes ( needs to be sharpened very badly‚Ä¶"
"We had definitely the best holiday feeling here.  The various restaurants were all very good, ocean of course exceptional with all the wild life it has to offer. We got lucky and saw turtles coming out of the nest one night. Unforgettable experience.  Diving with Mantas is just around the corner and the biologists hold good lectures about nature and marine life.  Would always come back!!!"
"My partner and I have been raving about Six Senses for 2 weeks now and we cannot recommend it highly enough. I have been to other Six Senses resorts, but this one just blew me away.  Our experience with them from being met upon arrival right through to our departure was seamless. Below are a few things we love about them.  - Conservation and environmental sustainability.  - Accommodation - simply excellent. We stayed in the Lagoon Water Villa which is closer to the amenities the resort had to offer. It was spacious but cosy, beautifully furnished without being pretentious, just pure barefoot luxury in a Robinson Crusoe way. We also stayed one night in the Ocean Water Villa which was just as good but you need a buggy or a bike to get everywhere as it is further away from the main‚Ä¶"
"From the second we arrived at Six Senses Laamu we felt relaxed and welcome.  The staff is very accommodating and helpful and make sure that guests want for nothing while there.  Our G.E.M., Ashfag (Kokko), made our stay very memorable with bookings and excursions.   The House Reef at Six Senses is filled with incredible wildlife including sea turtles, rays, and little sharks.  The dive center was well equipped to help me learn to dive in a safe, friendly environment.  It was truly a perfect honeymoon."
"A surprisingly big hotel complex on a small island in Laamu Atol, yet it doesn‚Äôt feel remotely crowded or over populated. Very tranquil laid back ambiance, so if you like lots of activities, speedboats etc. discos, or dressing up for dinner this is not place for you. Great snorkelling. Great yoga and spa facilities. Mix of luxurious on beach villas or wooden chalets on constructed pontoons. 4 or 5 restaurants contributing to small hotel feel. Very friendly unpushy staff who address you on first name terms. free ice home made ice cream. What more could you want for lazy 10 day stay. Will return and would definitely recommend. You should choose right time to go. We had a couple of rainy days but lots to do."
An amazing 10 days at Six Senses Laamu As close to an island paradise as you can get. The perfect romantic holiday retreat. A special mention for Raheem the wonderfully creative head chef at Leaf restaurant who made some amazing special vegetarian dishes for my wife and for Abdulla our GEM (guest experience maker) who unobtrusively ensured everything was perfect 
"From the warmth and hospitality of the staff to superb food: every day there was a joy . Marine biologists on hand to explain and help you get the most out of the amazing surrounding ocean and abundance of sea life . We were lucky enough to name a new green turtle we spotted on a snorkelling trip with Jenni . There is a glorious relaxed atmosphere here . Cycling along the wooden jettys and sandy island is a treat . Our favourite afternoon hang out was the huge comfy beds at the chill bar sipping cocktails and lying in hammocks over the ocean . It is a very special place ; eco conscious , healthy food if you want it , free ice cream bar . We stayed in a sunset water villa which had unobstructed views of the ocean . We came back refreshed and relaxed . Special hotel in a special‚Ä¶"
"I and my husband are still dreaming about this place, we were there for 8 days but it felt like a month.  Amazing coral, amazing water bungalow with AMAZING team.  We felt like in heaven and we are planning to go back next year, the only problem about this place is that makes you addicted and sad (VERY very sad) to leave.  And we CAN'T forget to comment: MOST AMAZING FOOD EVER. Leaf is the best and well as the chef (you need to reserve it before).  the only little thing we would change would be the mattress - with memory foam. Six Senses Laamu, we are counting the days to see you soon again. MISS YOU and happy one year anniversary to us 3, it almost one year that we have met <3"
"Six Senses Laamu is located not far away from Male. The Staff will receive you from Male airport, escort you to domestic terminal. it is about 40mins by domestic flight, once you landing, your G.E.M will received you from the arrival hall. He/She will take you to the speedboat pier which is about 20mins from the pier to resort. After that, You will arrive the Paradise!!! On the way to resort, you may see the dolphins(here if you are lucky enough, you will see the dolphins everyday). The resort is amazing, they have 6 restaurants in total opened from different times. Foods are yummy. Different activities daily will never makes you boring. Six Senses Spa is a must try item. It also has a private sandbank.  The ocean biologists will teach you lots of knowledge like dolphins / sea‚Ä¶"
"Cycling with a bike that has my initial tag through the breezy, vegetated, and slightly meandering road in Six Senses Laamu was one of the most enjoyable activities in the island. We were encouraged to keep our footwear away, and to leave nothing but our footprints. It was so rejuvenating to be able to leave our villa and move around the island by our bike without forgetting to wear anything on our feet. Kudos to the staff who ensure that the walkways are basically safe for guests to tread on. We stayed in an Ocean Beach Villa, and it was just amazing. The superb privacy, the lush vegetation surrounding our villa, the romantic outdoor shower, and of course the intense woody elements of the villa furniture and architecture blend so well that by just idling around inside my villa‚Ä¶"
"To summarise:  The accommodation was excellent; open air showers, wonderful villas over water and everything g you would hope for from a luxurious Maldives resort.   The staff were utterly superb, everyone from our GEM, Nadjar, to my diving instructor, Hassan. They were all lovely and made our stay.   Restaurants were all fabulous. Breakfast was great, every other meal also. There was literally nothing they could t do for us.   We did plenty of diving and the cleaning station provided amazing sights of rays, small sharks and turtles. Everywhere else since has been a little lacklustre.   The management was also amazing, not just at a high level but also for the small details. You really can‚Äôt go wrong. "
"We have just returned from six days in villa 56 at Six Senses.Very comfortable but a bit far from the central area although you are given bikes to ride around the island.  Excellent, very well run resort. Soft sand beaches, clear blue waters, large infinity pool. We thought the food was excellent  and liked the fact that while we were on full board there were no restrictions on which of the several restaurants we ate in and no sudden extra charges. They have a large air-conditioned hut offering the most delicious range of cheeses. The journey to Laamu is a trifle bothersome as once you get to Male, you have to get on a plane for another 50 minutes and then a further 20 mins on a boat. But it was well worth it. There is a dive school here and although the coral has been damaged,‚Ä¶"
"After our wedding and honeymoon plans had to be changed due to the hurricane in the carribean late last September/October our travel agents recommend this beautiful and absolutely idyllic honeymoon destination.  There is always a silver lining... (as they say)  Sixth Senses offers tranquility, health living & lifestyle and pure luxury.  The journey to get to Sith Senses as with some of the other hotels within the Maldives means that you have to take a domestic flight south of Male.  From there you are greeted by Sixth sense Reps, who start your visitor experience from that point.  You are guided 300 meters down the road to a nearby jetty, where you are boarded on to a Sixth Sense speedboat.

A perfect place for a family trip. We stayed in a family beach villa with pool.  Pluses: - remoteness from Male. Nowadays when you stay clos to Male your Maldivian experience is almost ruined by the view of huge ocean ships and a great number of boats passing by. Here the resort is the only one at the atoll what makes the feeling of real Maldives very strong. And quite a short flight on local airways is not a problem and rather is a small adventure. - great sea and beach! White sandy beach (sand is very fine and soft to walk) with sea deep enough to swim almost to the wall during high tide. Sunbeds of each room are very from each other. Green bushes separate each beach villa - Privacy. You almost don't see other people unless you are in common zone (dining or big swimming pool).‚Ä¶
"Where do i begin with this wonderful resort!  This was our third trip to the maldives and our fourth different resort and once again the maldives has proven to be the most beautiful place on earth.  The six senses laamu was an absolute treat, to begin with the six senses is an eco friendly and barefoot resort. I really loved their take on the environment and especially the way they give back to the local communites. Id like to point out that im not usually a fan of wearing no footwear but wow it really worked here. I cant explain just how comfortable and relaxed it made me feel! Definitely go no shoes! (I dont usually write lengthy reviews but i feel it is warranted here as i could go on and on)  We stayed in 2 overwater villas, rooms were spacious and the outdoor shower‚Ä¶"
"After a horrific experience at a nearby island, the staff at Six Senses saved our vacation and made an incredible experience for my entire family.  From the moment we pulled up, the staff was fantastic, gave extremely thorough information regarding the resort, what was available, where everything was located, etc.  Also, there is a doctor on the island and emergency plans and equipment located throughout the entire island (VITAL to have after the experience at our other island).  The food is beyond words and the most delicious we had on our 3 week trip.  We loved engaging with the staff and listening to stories.  Our only regret is that we didn't have more time here.  The bikes provided to ride around were so much fun, the gym was well equipped and the staff even opened it early‚Ä¶"
The most wellness concept I have ever been! The first I had a medical screening with Ayurvedic doctor. Even I had perfect results he recommends me some more proper food and exercises. I loved the herbal concept. And as a passionate diver I highly recommend diving here! The signature dive sites are the channels especially with incoming current. My very last dive I have seen more than 50 grey reef sharks!
"My family spent December holidays at Six Senses Laamu - our 3rd Christmas in 4 years.  Obviously, we love it. We've stayed at three Maldives hotels (Gili Lankanfushi and Anantara Dhigu), and we prefer Six Senses. It takes an extra journey (the connecting flight from Male), but we think it's worth it. The resort has a more pristine, eco-friendly, isolated, boutique feel, as opposed to the others which feel more like standard beach resorts. We appreciate the use of glass/ceramic refillable drinking water bottles and toiletries, as opposed to single-use plastic. Six Senses' villas have a more beachy/island feel than Dhigu; and while Gili's villas are beautiful, roomy, the water underneath is too shallow to jump in. The children are so happy and independent at Six Senses -- riding‚Ä¶"
"Experience you have to repeat. Our vacation started from the 5th till the 11th. of Jan. Water villa was amazing, we enjoyed the bikes and walking with no shoes.

Special thanks to Mr.Mina Hanna, front office manger we felt free & at our home. It was very easy to make anything we want, thanks to him. Special thanks also to all GEM team they work as one family with high teamwork spirit and they were so friendly. Thanks to Parrie and the checolate gift from him.

"My Wife and I spent 10 amazing days at a Laamu Water Villa on Jetty A which is the jetty closest to the restaurants (the best one in our opinion).  Our view was spectacular and very private.  We went during ""monsoon"" season ""May 29 - June 8"" and had 1 day of rain.  The rest of the days were full of sunshine with weather averaging mid to high 80s.  It was spectacular. Capacity at the resort was around 30% so we never had to wait for anything and had the full attention of the staff everywhere we went!  By the 2nd day, the Six Senses staff knew us by first name and our daily routine (where we liked to sit, what we ordered, fav beverages, etc).  It was truly a 5 star experience. Our favorite excursion was the Scuba.  We finished our PADI certification at the resort and took classes‚Ä¶"
"My husband and I stayed here in December and were blessed with 10 days of amazing sunshine and not a single drop of rain!   To the potential guests reading this, here is my comprehensive and very honest overview of Six Senses Laamu.   We had a extremely smooth transition to the resort having flown all the way from Sydney, don't book the cheaper flights, pay that little bit extra, go through Singapore (if flying from Aus), it's well worth the money. If you land late into Male' stay overnight at the Hotel Ocean Grand Hulhumale (right next to the Male' airport). We had a wonderful nights stay here!

Can‚Äôt say enough good things about this place! I am impressed with the sustainability of the coral reefs and fisheries. The villas are designed with the rustic feel and has that island shack kinda feel but with lovely luxuries of course. We had over water villa in jetty C and the view was spectacular!   First impression with arrival to Male we were greeted by six senses staff to be escorted to private lounge (didn‚Äôt look exclusive or private as there was people everywhere) they have buffet all you can eat as we waited for the next internal flight.

"We have travelled to the Maldives many times but this was our first visit to Laamu.  We had high expectations having stayed at other Six Senses properties and we were not dissapointed.  Although the travel time is long due to the domestic transfer and then a boat trip it was worth it on arrival.  The best parts  Really great to see Mark the F and B director who we had met previously at Moofushi, he is a real asset and looked after us brilliantly.  Amazing food at all the restaurants. The quality of food was fantastic at all of them, we particularly liked Leaf and Zen.

"Paradise found! Amazing resort with over the water villa, amazing snorkeling and food was fantastic! We thoroughly dis-connected from the modern world and loved being ""barefoot and happy."" The room was a dream, outdoor shower and infinity pool were sublime.  The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, especially our GEM, Sato, who made our week a complete pleasure.  And if the endless blue ocean and star-filled night sky aren't relaxing enough, the spa is complete luxury.  The resort exceeded our expectations and we cannot rec commend it highly enough!!"

This was our second time to Six Senses Laamu and somehow it managed to exceed our first trip. We have visited the Maldives several times staying at different hotels and this is our absolute favourite. It is the epitome of barefoot luxury. The yoga with Sandra was magical and we had the most incredible experience with Dr. Jitendra and Vinod who were incredibly knowledgable in Ayurveda. These experiences are gifts of that we will carry with us always and go beyond a vacation! Thank you!
"We stayed in this beautiful resort for our honeymoon. It was the best decision we have ever made! The over water villa was an absolute perfection! And the service was more than a 5 star service. Every single staff member is a great, friendly and fun individual :)  The resort is beautiful with a great variety of activities and good restaurants. Even when it rained we had the best day ever in the spa and at the bar ;)   Actually, everything about this resort is amazing and we cannot recommend it enough!  We will be returning in the future 100% - we cannot wait to relive those perfect days.   Thank you all for the best honeymoon we could have imagined!"
"We had an amazing week at Six Senses Laamu despite some unseasonable unsettled weather most of the time.  We loved staying in an over-water villa and were very impressed with all its facilities.  Provision of bikes is an excellent idea and a lot of fun for getting around the island, to/from meals, etc.   The no shoe policy is also a great leveller - everyone is the same, and it also reduces the need to get too dressed up for meals when you go bare foot on a bicycle!  We liked being on Jetty A and close to amenities, which turned out to be very convenient as we had a lot of rain.  Sadly strong winds and showers precluded many of the water sports as it was too rough for canoeing and even snorkelling was quite choppy - there were plenty of colourful reef fish, turtles and rays but‚Ä¶"

The resort itself is quite far away from Mal√© so even though we flew from Singapore (not too far from the Maldives) in the morning, by the time we arrived at the resort, it was already night time and dark so we couldn't really see much during the connecting flight and the short boat ride there.

The water in incredible! The reef is easily accessible from the main part of the resort and has an insane variety of beautiful sea life. Diving here is also a must as they have local sites full of large turtles and even manta rays. Night life is quiet as you would expect in most Maldives islands. There are almost 100 villas, which allow for up to 200 guests. The resort was 80% full when we were there, off peak in mid Nov.

Everything from the greeting and pick up at the Male airport to the drop off back at Male airport was truly of ""5 star luxury standard"". In particular, Mr. Hollow G.E.M (Guest Experience Maker) took great care of us and anticipated our every need to ensure our stay was seamless and stress-free.

Zen, the Japanese place, was great, though Japanese people might have been scared by all the basils leaves and mayonnaise on some sushi.  - the bed is small (I mean, normal size... usually we have bigger beds in luxury hotels) - snorkeling gear is complimentary (and it was expected to be so), though you will be charged if you loose it (which has happened to our snorkel during the snorkeling tour - 17US++ for a‚Ä¶"

It‚Äôs about a 45min flight from Male and then a 20min speedboat ride., but once you arrive you will have stepped into eco heaven. I won‚Äôt give too much away, all I can say is the management are exceptional when it comes to service. From the moment they meet you at the airport to the time they leave you at airport the Six Senses delivers. The things i will never forget are the overwater villas. Breathtakingly beautiful. Top marks for the interior designers who have made it exciting for guests: glass bottom baths, loo floors with views to the lagoon beneath, open air‚Ä¶"

"Six Senses Laamu is quite an expensive hotel if you travel during high season.  What I loved about this hotel the most was the food. The food is absolutely excellent and cooked at high standards.  The island is extremely beautiful with incredible water and sunsets.  Snorkelling is a must as the ocean life has much to offer.  Service was great too, we had our rep called Alex and she did help and explain everything.  Overall was one of the top most relaxing holiday I ever had!   "
"We had a pool villa in the end of water villa, we can snorkeling by the villla with a lot of fishes and coral,I saw a little white shark next to the villa , room is clean and perfect. Love the glass floor in toilet , glass bath so We can see the fishes down of the villa.Beautiful place for stars, beach,great food + free icecream.  "
"We went with another couple to celebrate our husbands 50th.  We'd been planning to make this trip to the Maldives for over 15 years and it did not disappoint! The Atoll is remote and it's a trek to get there...but its totally is worth it!  If you are a diver...it well worth it.  The remoteness of this resort lends itself to less traffic for divers and dives sites that are less damaged by safari boat excursions.  The Diving outfit on site is one of the best we've experienced in over 20 years of diving.  They host marine biologist from all over the world to study the ecosystem for a good reason. They are concierge diving at its best.  More about the resort. It's unique in its ""barefoot luxury"" approach to service and I loved the resort is eco friendly and conscientious. You just‚Ä¶"
"My husband and I recently celebrated our five year wedding anniversary at Six Senses Laamu, and we could not have imagined a more perfect setting. This resort is 5 star in every possible way! When we pulled up to the jetty from the transfer boat, we could not believe our eyes. The resort looks like it is straight out of a dream.  The grounds are absolutely stunning! Beaches are all pristine, bike trails through the island are kept clean and manicured, the organic garden on sight provides fresh herbs and produce for the restaurants, the docks are all well maintained and the rooms are incredible.  We stayed in an overwater ocean bungalow, and we were blown away by the rustic luxury. The bed was so comfortable, they even had a pillow menu for you to chose from! The indoor/outdoor‚Ä¶"
We have returned from Maldives - Six Senses Laamu and all we can say is WOW - as seasoned travelers - we always expect exceptional  but Six Senses Laamu is just sublime - what a breathtakingly beautiful location incredible service and thorough attention to detail and truly spell binding resort.  Food is exceptional - service is flawless !!  Every single member of staff went above and beyond to ensure our comfort -  Special Mention of the following individuals Frans Westraadt -Resident Manager & his team Great Job you personify the values of your brand well done !

"If Paradise should ever be placed on earth we are pretty sure it would be on Six Senses Laamu. The location with reef just at your fingertips from Chill Bar, the concept of creating a sublime experience, where you feel nothing else looked after 24/7 by staff, GEM's, kitchen and waiters makes Six Senses the most perfect place to have a vacation.   Totally love the barefoot idea. We were given a dust bag to keep our shoes even before we step foot on the island and shoes are not needed throughout our stay.   Meals were awesome. In villa breakfast is generous and sumptuous. Dinner at Leaf Restaturant and the Sunday Lobster BBQ is exceptional!   Last but not least, thank you so much to our GEM Najah and Alex. You have gone the extra mile to make sure everything is so well taken care‚Ä¶"
"We stayed in the hotel from 30th October to 3rd November in an overwater villa with pool.  The overall experience was excellent. At our arrival all the management team was waiting for us, they introduced themselves and soon after those presentations, our GEM (sort of Butler) came straight to us to meet us. She knew all our information and she arranged a tour of the facilities.  The hotel has around 100 villas in a quite big island (compared to other Maldivian islands/resorts) all for itself. I was quite impressed for all this welcome ceremony, I felt they were focusing on the minimal details which was confirmed during all our stay. Despite of supposing the hotel was quite full of costumers, all was extremely quiet and calm (maybe due to the size of the island). They gave us 2‚Ä¶"
The Maldives has been on the top of my ‚Äúbucket list‚Äù for many years so when my husband and I decided to plan a special holiday to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary (which was also the belated honeymoon we never had) the Maldives seemed the perfect choice. The big decision was deciding where to stay.  The water colour of the lagoon that surrounds Six Senses Laamu is simply mesmerising. The resort has everything you could possibly need or want and given its remote locationÔºåthe eco-friendly/sustainability focus is very impressive.   The stunning locationÔºå luxurious resort facilities and incredible food is only surpassed by the beautiful staffÔºåof which there are hundreds.   My husband and I agree that our fondest memories from our stay at Six Senses Laamu will be our daily‚Ä¶
"So, where do I start‚Ä¶My husband and I thought very hard about where we were going to spend our honeymoon, knowing full well that it was going to be a very long, expensive trip if we chose to go to the Six Senses Laamu in the Maldives, and let me tell you, it was completely worth it.Let me tell you about this wonderful, magical place!   Once we landed via the transfer airplane we were greeted by a sea boat staff where they treated us with a drink (I think it was some derivative of lemongrass) and some fresh coconut.  Then, upon pulling up to the resort via our sea boat we were literally greeted by a big pack of wild dolphins ‚Äì it was like something out of a movie ‚Äì it was amazing.  Once our boat docked we were greeted by all the staff, all of whom were incredibly friendly,‚Ä¶"
"As my title suggests, this place is very hit and miss. We visited the property for 4 nights on the last leg of our honeymoon and feel very conflicted about recommending this resort.   Let's begin with the reservation and payment process. We booked an advance purchase package months in advance. Despite sending the required CC info during booking (on their website), they sent us a bunch of forms to fill out to send back requiring the same information. We sent it back promptly and expected to be charged right away, as instructed on their forms and website.   Nope. To make this part short - it took them MONTHS to process the card. In fact, I found out my card was declined on their end due to my Canadian bank's security program. (The program automatically declines potentially‚Ä¶"
"My husband took me to the Six Senses, Laamu, for our 10th wedding anniversary... To add some context, we have been to the Maldives before (W Resort) and have been to many beautiful 5* hotels in the India Ocean, Far East and Middle East but this place is just something else!  I have never been anywhere where service is consistently outstanding. There was not one thing that I could cite as negative about our stay.   We stayed in a lagoon villa, which was fab. Food is amazing, pool area fantastic and spa immense.   I also loved that the hotel is heavily into sustainability and this isn't just lip service. Do the back of house tour and see for yourself.  We were very lucky during our stay, we saw 100s of dolphins on a sunset cruise, which we were told is quite unusual to see so many‚Ä¶"
From the moment you arrive you are asked to remove your shoes as the only thing you should leave is your footprint. At the speedboat we were met with cooling towels and homemade lemonade just another touch that you are made to feel special. Coming up to the main jetty you are greeted by you own personal GEM who is there to look after your every need.  And then you are taken to your villa which is just ‚Äòwow‚Äô! You have all the amenities you need and beautiful outside showers and the beds are so comfortable! We had an over water villa so we had our own customised push bikes which is such a lovely touch.  All the restaurants serve fresh delicious food with all the meals. Nothing like having breakfast watching a turtle swim past!  The surf here is great as you have the world class‚Ä¶
"There are no words to describe the beauty of this place, untouched. Service, food, water. Hands down best vacation I've ever been on. You feel like you stepped into paradise. The color of the water...just wow..."
"I have been planning to visit Maldives for last few months.. & finally got a chance to visit during last week of September spilling to first week of October.  I must say that I made the right decision to book six senses over any other resort .. we had an unbelievably good experience.. this is the best place I have ever been in my life .  Hospitality of this resort is top notch, they take care of every possible thing that you can think of like your choice of food , the demands of your kids etc.  The  villas are beautiful,we were fortunate to get the overwater Villa with uninterrupted view .  They have raised our expectations,I doubt if I am going to like the hospitality of any other hotel  so much after staying with Six senses Laamu .  Hope to visit this in future again "
"Had an amazing time at this resort. You can do as much as you want or as little as possible. The view, food,accommodation and staff went above our expectations. Our over water villa was to die for and loved all our toiletries in the villa. We had all the meals included in our package and we weren't disappointed. Loved all the restaurants but our favourite was Leaf! The chef's out did themselves. The snorkelling was first class. Had some wonderful day spa packages while we were there and Bo and Som were amazing at the spa.We can't wait to go back again and stay for longer next time."
"Almost 30 hours of traveling, coming from California, was all worth it! Once my wife and I saw the clear turquoise waters and amazing views, we forgot about how long we have traveled. From the moment we stepped off the speedboat, we were warmly greeted by Marteyne, the GM, and other management staff, and introduced to our GEM (guest experience manager) Tom. From then on, we were under Tom's care. He definitely did not disappoint. He checked on us everyday to make sure we were satisfied with everything. He was easy to get a hold of and always tried his best to accommodate our needs and requests. Tom is one of the reasons we loved our stay at the resort. As I mentioned earlier, the views on this place are gorgeous. The pictures and videos can't do justice as to how beautiful this‚Ä¶"
" This was our third visit to Six Senses Laamu and it was as wonderful as ever. It is our little paradise and we will return whenever we can. It is the perfect place to rest and have fun too. The people are amazing, the food is very tasty and there are many interesting activities to do eg diving, for me this is one of the best places in the world to dive. Totally recommended."
We check in at Six Senses Laamu this Nov and I am now a little concerned reading some of the reviews here. About bad GEM's and hard selling staff. I haven't disclosed the resort name to my family; keeping it a surprise as we will be celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary as well as birthday's of both our daughter's. I Hope their surprise doesn't turn into disappointment if any of the above issues happen to us during our stay. Hope the management is taking above issues seriously and fix things so all future guests are well taken care off and have a great experience like with most reviews I have read here.
"I am sure that the reviews of this hotel differ because of the accommodation you choose. We were perfectly placed in Ocean Beach Villa with pool, which was just perfectly amazing and give you the impression of being alone on the whole island. The ocean can be easily seen from your bed and this is paradise. The room is spacious: bedroom, two wardrobes, two sinks in the form of a suitcases, two showers (indoor and outdoor, however the ""indoor"" one is outside, the difference between them is that the indoor one has a roof, the outdoor does not), toilet, bath, several sofas (in bedroom, in shower and close to the swimming pool) and an upside terrace (perfect place for in villa breakfast). The swimming pool is nice especially at night (perfect view on the stars), but the most amazing‚Ä¶"
"Arrival was perfect. Felt like we just step into paradise. My Husband and I arrived and were welcomed by the RM, Franz in a very warm manner. There are also other key staff who stood there and welcomed us. We were told by Franz that there will be a Guest Experience Maker (GEM) who would take care of us during our 4 days 3 nights stay and get us what we need.   Our GEM, Shifu was not warm at all, unfortunately. We stayed in Villa 15. We were told by Shifu that the room is an upgrade, which my Husband said no, we reserved the laamu water villa. She got the info wrongly but didn't apologise for it. Also, when I called her, she always seems really busy and sometimes didn't pick up the call.  What impressed me: the beach at Sip Sip, the villas, the ice bar, the personalised bikes,‚Ä¶"
Context: family traveling with 1x 3yo and first time in Maldives and a six senses.  Like many other reviewers we found this hotel to be one of the best if not the best hotel we have ever stayed in. The Service and attention to detail is sensational and truly matches the natural beauty of the island. Where honeymooners and families perfectly coexist!  The resort itself was built by the soneva group and the resort is still run on the founders ethos. We stayed on a half board package and I fully expected our options to be limited but we could dine at any of the four restaurants which keeps things interesting. This seems to be a general theme in the hotel as there are no hidden extras. Indeed they even have a free all you can eat ice cream parlour which in typical six senses style‚Ä¶
"Our first visit to the Maldives...hopefully not the last! We had an incredible time at the Six Senses Laamu Resort. We knew absolutely nothing about the Six Sense brand before we went, but we were glad to choose them. They place an emphasis on conservation and energy efficiency which we appreciate. More than that, though, the staff was just amazing. Special kudos to our GEM (Guest Experience Manager) Sato - he was tremendous. One example: we had booked a romantic beach dinner for our anniversary, but it was rained out. Sato arranged for a private dinner for us upstairs in one of the dining areas instead, complete with candles and sand (in jars). Truly above and beyond. We went towards the end of the rainy season, but it did not affect us much. Mostly, the rain showers would pass‚Ä¶"
 In one word...Perfection.  Loved every moment of our stay.  Every touch point was a moment of magic as every host provided impeccable service with sincerity and warmth.  The resort facilities were top notch without losing its rustic charm...add to that the crystal clear turquoise waters.  We especially enjoyed the delectable food at every meal.  Swimming with turtles in your house reef and just outside our villa was just magical! Thank you to the entire team at Six Senses Laamu and keep up the great work!  We will certainly be back soon.
"This was a bucket list trip for us as we'd been wanting to travel to the Maldives for more than 30 years. We were so HAPPY with our choice of Six Senses!! From the time you arrive by speed boat, you feel like you've been transported to a faraway paradise. A fantastic place to kick back and relax or go for some great dives with the mantas. We truly enjoyed all the great restaurants, especially 'Sip Sip' after diving and 'The Chill Bar' for a sunset drink. We had superb meals at all the restaurants and also enjoyed the buffet nights at Longitude. The staff were all so friendly and bent over backwards to make sure we had everything we needed and were enjoying ourselves. Hated to leave at the end of week and hope we can return again someday."
"This was our second visit to the maldives and frankly we hesitated going to a different resort because we were so happy with our first visit. But after visiting six senses Laamu the Maldives has become even more special to us.. I don't kmow where to start we had 6 days in paradise.We stayed in villas number 15 and 16. The location was outstanding we washed our faces evry morning in the cristal clear sea right in front of us,the coeral reef was a 2 minute swim from our room the sun set view was impeccable. The ffod in all restaurants were all more than perfect especially Hisham in the international restaurant turned our holiday into a memorable one he did his best for us at our breakfasts and dinners too many thanks to him and all the chefs and other staff..Everybody was so‚Ä¶"
"Where to start! Just cruising from the airport to the hotel was taken out of a movie! Six senses looked like a luxury type 'water world'! We had chosen an Ocean villa at Jetty C and were happy with that as it is quieter even though it's further away (we loved the little bike ride to breakfast and dinner.) We loved everything from the decor to the ambiance to the space and the privacy of the villa to the sublime food at Leaf restaurant (we ended up there almost every night.) I don't think there's anything we didn't love. (Except we got lost and missed movie night, but that was our fault.) The breakfasts were to die for with the happiest 'pancake man' I've ever seen. The ice cream selection, the chill vibe at Chill, the spa was nice, my husband loved the gym!  I miss Six senses‚Ä¶"
"If you're looking for the perfect get-away, look no further than Six Senses Laamu. Hospitality abounds from the moment you arrive and the entire staff truly makes you feel like their most special guest.  Your personal butler, or 'GEM', ensures that your stay is exactly what you wish for. Villas over the water have every amenity and offer stunning views of the ocean equipped with hammock over the water, seating areas with couches, tables, and even your own balcony. Snorkel right off your own deck! Guests are provided with a bicycle to navigate the island, making for a really fun experience. We came for diving, but one can take surfing lessons as well. The dive staff was attentive, thorough, and had extensive knowledge of the area in order that guests had the best diving‚Ä¶"
"We loved our stay at Laamu, the food,wine and service was world class 5 star! We will differently return, hopefully next year!  Ice cream shop was a treat too! Great idea. Maybe a late check( no extra charge as we have experienced before in the Maldives) out for those who`s flight leaves later at night would be a nice touch."
"There is nothing like Six Senses Laamu for the ultimate in relaxation. This eco-sophisticated resort is truly one with nature and goes overboard to help keep our world pristine, while providing guests with the best possible vacation retreat.  Guests are treated to barefoot luxury with a quiet private natural vibe. Each guest's personal attendant ""GEM"" ensures every need is provided. The over-water villas are exquisite. Community areas delightfully designed with natural materials. Fun activities are at your fingertips. Innovative marine professionals are on staff to ensure sustainability and cutting-edge research on local habitat. Enjoy true serenity.  "
"Looking for an island experience...Six Senses Laamu will give you holiday memories that will last forever. Whilst the weather in Aug/Sept can be overcast the experience is no way dampened. We stayed in a villa over the ocean with of all things a glass floor in the loo so you can watch the sea while doing your business, quite a unique experience. Sit on the deck either at a sunken glass top table and glass floor while having room service breakfast or evening drinks before dinner. Climb down the ladder from your deck and swim in the clearest water I've ever seen. If you love islands take the Robinson Caruso deserted island trip. You are taken to your own island for the day with a sumptuous hamper of food and drinks. It is truly and incredible experience to be on your own to swim,‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses is in all means a paradise: Great accommodation, great food, loving staff and awesome waves!  Don't miss the cinema after dinner! Try the tuna cone at the Japanese restaurant! Ask for a special juice at breakfast made specially for you! Get a ride around the island with your bike! Try all the 42 ice cream flavours they offer as a compliment all day! And, of course, experiment any massage at the wonderful spa they have!!!   I will come back many times with all family for sure!!!"
"The stay with six senses is simply gorgeous and memorable. From transport arrangement to accommodation to F and B, everything was handled perfectly. Very beautiful resort with cozy designed room. I really enjoy the bare foot walking experience around the small island. The service was great - our village attendant Tom did a fabulous job in making sure everything went smooth. He helped us to pre-arrange and pre-book the dinner venues to ensure we have a try on all restaurants with different types of cuisines. Food was delicious - breakfast buffet with tones of options from drinks to food, the fine dining restaurant was amazing as I could still recall the beef tenderloin we ordered was cooked perfectly - juicy, tender, just simply delicious, and Japanese food was up to standard as‚Ä¶"

You really are so well looked after my everyone from start to finish. The adventure starts when you get to Male. A Six Senses Representative meets you and takes you to the lounge to wait for your plane. You really don't have to think for yourself which is great. The Lounge is private and comfy, I had a quick nap in there before catching the internal flight to recharge by batteries. After a half hour flight and 20 mins approx speedboat you arrive at Laamu.

"We spent an amazing week at Six Senses Laamu for our honeymoon (with part 2 in Sri Lanka). If you are on the fence whether Six Senses is worth it, here are the five things that really made Six Senses stand out for us:   1. The food: We were on half board and seldom ate during the day because the breakfast and meal credit was sufficient to keep us going, but was also amazing quality. The breakfast was absolutely fantastic; such a wide range of fruit, healthy and international options. The juice choices were also fantastic and we enjoyed trying different ones throughout the stay. The dinner options were also great. Some people on this forum don't rate Longitude but we had our best meals there; the selection and quality was brilliant. I do recommend booking Zen in advance, and it's‚Ä¶"
"I have just come back from the most amazing trip to Six Senses Laamu.  If you are undecided as to where to book in the Maldives then Laamu is a must. I have stayed at six of the Sixth Senses properties now including Oman, Thailand & Vietnam. I love going to new Six Senses resorts as not only are they located in the coolest quirky of places but they are modern in a high end rustic theme.They are all eco friendly and truly help with sustainability & caring for the environment.  As soon as you get to Male airport and meet a Six Senses representative, you really don't need to think for yourself, they take care of everything.

We had a wonderful time on our second honeymoon at Six Senses. Wish we would have come here the first time! I love the outdoors and adventure and the accommodations were just perfect! Every little detail of the resort was thought of. The ambience of the whole island lent to relaxation and rejuvenating vibes. Although the island was at nearly full occupancy you would have never thought so. There were always seats open for dining somewhere and at the beach. The food was excellent and we followed others advise and found a server we liked and tried to get him for the majority of our meals (his name was Jabeer). We were very pleased with the hospitality of the staff.  The only surprise on our trip was that the connecting flight at Male was not as smooth as I had anticipated. We had‚Ä¶

The resort gives you the best of everything. The staff is amazing - will come back to that later. The food, offers a great variety and everyday in every restaurant you leave the meal satisfied. The color of the water is even more pretty than on pictures. The excursions could seem a bit expensive, but with the quality of guides, number of animals, food and generel WOW effect, it is all worth it.

"For our tenth anniversary, we came to the Maldives and stayed in five different resorts. They were all amazing, but my wife said that, if she could only recommend one, this would be it! It truly is a phenomenal place!  Here are all the things that sets Six Senses apart from all the others:   1) Swimming with turtles in the lagoon - We had an overwater villa, and there were turtles that just frolicked right in front of our villa. They were always playing there, and would even swim alongside us when we got into the perfect blue waters.  2) The overwater hammocks - Admittedly we did see this at one other resort, but this is truly special: to be swinging in a hammock in the middle of aquamarine seas. Paradise!  3) All-you-can-eat free ice cream - There's an ice cream bar with more‚Ä¶"

From arrival to depart (including transfers) they take care about everyting. You feel like there is no people in hotel during your stance regardless maybe hotel it's full."
"Our airport pick up was seamless, it was warm and personal to be addressed by our first names when we arrived at the resort,and the service standards were very high and efficient right through our stay. We stayed both on the beach and over the water bungalows. However both don't offer complete privacy. Too many guests in the resort. Given the price, the food was very average.  The free ice creams are quite a bonanza and lots of options for water activities, including getting to surf with Tropicsurf  "
"We stayed at SSL in March 2017. For first-timers in Maldives, it was absolutely stunning. Everything we imagined plus more. SSL offered great rooms, great food and fantastic activities. The diving was phenomenal and the snorkelling was good too. Even though the house reef could be a little more spectacular, we still saw stingrays, turtles and schools of fish. It was a little heartbreaking though to see the extent of the coral bleaching.   The rooms were fantastic. We stayed in a Laamu Water Villa on Pier A and we also had a sunset view. It was stunning. The service though was a little inconsistent. The F&B staff, room service and general staff were fantastic. We got to know most of them by name as they knew our names. However, our GEM seems to prefer other clients for whatever‚Ä¶"
"Great hotel, excellent beach. However for me it was too crowded. The main restaurant Longitude was average, so I recommend to visit Leaf restaurant which is located high in a lush greenery. You can reach it by going along the small hanging bridge. The food there is delicious! But you should book in advance: the restaurant is closed on some days and is very popular. You can also dine at Zen restaurant serving japanese cuisine. It is really good!  And again book in advance because this place is quite small. Every day I visited with my family Ice and chocolate studio where are extremely wide selection of ice cream and all this goodies are for free! My little daughter was delighted.

"Overall, it was one of the best holidays we've ever taken! The Maldives has such a high expectation and our experience was still phenomenal and beat expectations! One of the main reasons was the attentive and thoughtful care of the staff and the resort's attention to every detail around the Six Senses theme. One underrated area was the food. We enjoyed nearly all of our meals and the selection was great!  The entire experience from the time they greet you at MLE airport to the moment you leave is managed very well.  We stayed for one week and I can confirm this is the right amount of time to stay there.

"This is really an amazing hotel! The service is probably the best I have ever experienced. They clearly communicate well between the staff. For example, at the beginning of the holiday we were asked if we had any food allergies and never had to mention it again but were kindly notified at any of the restaurants if we ordered something containing that ingredient...impressive! The setting is absolutely stunning. The inside of the room could be a bit more spacious but the outside area is magical and of course the outside shower is a highlight. All of the food at the restaurants is delicious-- it's the right mix of being healthy and fresh but still really tasty. And there is free ice cream!

We had such a memorable honeymoon and all the staff were so friendly and always helpful. I want to also give a special thank you to our GEM Ali who was always there for anything we needed.

The villa had everything we could wish for (to name a few: direct view to sunset and sea, glass bottom coffee table, outside shower, a TV (which we never used), bathtub with glass bottom, a great mattress). The food at the resort is delicious. The staff is the best (special thanks to our GEM, Mafaz!) - very helpful, kind, attentive to detail.

We were there to celebrate our first wedding anniversary and my husband's b'day.... resort is so beautiful n it was a relaxing experience....i have given five 5 score for the staff in there.... Staff is very polite, always ready to help, they made sure we have comfortable stay. They pampered us with lots of complimentary cakes n champagne, drinks n so on. Chef always discussed menu with us in advance because we are vegetarian. Food was delicious n the way it was served was outstanding. Staff is very friendly n sweet. I have been to many places.

"We knew this trip would be special as we boarded the Six Senses speed boat transfer to the Hotel. We were offered shoebags for our shoes as they recommended a shoe-less week. On arrival at the hotel, the team was there to meet us and we were introduced to all. A quick tour bicycles allocated for our use and off to our water-villa. Everything about the place is special, however living on the water with constant water noise for 2 days made us feel ""sea-sick"" and we asked for a room on the land. A spectacular seaside room with a pool was given to us and this was literally ""paradise on earth"". We could not have asked for more. Every interaction with every staff member was perfect. Accommodating in every possible way, trained, friendly and willing to attend to every whim or need. The‚Ä¶"
"The Six Sense Laamu is truly exceptional.  Be prepared for something truly special.   From the amazingly clear - hundreds of different shades of blue water (pictures do not capture how blue and clear the water is!)  - to the white sandy beaches, the green lush plants and tropical trees, the amazing birds and cute little crabs darting here there and everywhere... you will be spoiled for natural beauty.  The resorts conscious focus on ecology and sustainability are to be commended (we were lucky enough to watch the turtle hatching's go out see one night!). Also, everyone gets there own bike to cycle around the island...  Six Senses Laamu is truly a paradise... You are welcomed warmly at the island airport, ushered onto a speed boat with a smile and refreshing lemonade and told to‚Ä¶"
"Clear blue water, white coral sand beaches makes Six Senses Laamu the closet thing to heaven. Stepped off the boat, take off the shoes with handed lemonade and fresh coconut, we had arrived in paradise.  All the staff were amazing & very friendly. Literally everyone working there was smiling and very polite and kind and extremely helpful. Service from everyone was done with a big smile.   All about sustainability are recycling. They even use desalinization to make their water.   One of my fave things bout the over water willa is the staricase that literally take u from the back deck into the ocean where you could encounter sea turtles easily !!. This trip was one of our best vacations yet. Memories made!"
"My husband and I visited Six Senses Laamu in May 2017. What an amazing, spectacular, magical spot! We had the time of our lives! To say that the resort is wonderful, is saying nothing at all, as it is really really fabulous! Starting from the resort itself and finishing with exceptionally wonderful people working in it - everything is on the highest level!  We stayed for 10 days and it simply isn't enough as there are so much to do! One is really given a choice to either hide away in a private paradise of the stunning water villa or to join the fabulous daily program that is really diverse and caters for different interests. Food is exceptional! My husband is a vegetarian and I am a vegan, and the chefs made sure that we had the tastiest, the most beautiful vegetarian/vegan food‚Ä¶"
"From the moment we were met at Male Airport by a Six Senses representative to the day we were farewelled at the speed boat.....I had an overwhelming sense of awe and continually had to pinch myself to be sure that I wasn't dreaming. Six Senses is beyond amazing, I cannot find the words for an accurate description!  The over water villa was sensational! The view from every corner was sublime! The color of the water was so unbelievably blue that it was difficult to turn your eyes away. The outdoor area offered the ultimate choices to lounge about in the shade or full sun or sit around a sunken table with a glass floor for viewing the tropical fish swimming below. Oh and there is a day bed on the roof top for star gazing at night!  Shifu was our GEM and she would come to see us at‚Ä¶"
"I have heard of Maldives but did not believe my eyes when I land on this Six Senses island. It's like a dream. The property is amazing and the staff are well trained! Our personal experience manager - Shifu was such an awesome person. She took care of us (a couple with 2.5 year old daughter) very well. The care was just to the point - not too close, but she's there once you need it. Very comfortable feeling!  I would highly recommend this report to anybody. "
"It doesn't get any better than this. The place is an absolute paradise. The quality of accommodation is as good as it gets. The restaurants are exquisite, the service is top notch and the staff should be rewarded with gold medals.... absolute perfect .... no less. I where so unfortunate to fall and get an injury. The why this was handled is overwhelming and I can find words to thank all the staff including the local doctor, our GEM Ashfaq and the GM Marteyne. One thing is absolutely certain - we will be back here soon. "
"Six Senses beat my wife and I expectations. The hospitality of the resort is incredible. The effort they put into sustainability is incredible because they keep the environment safe but maintain the luxuriousness of a high-end resort. One of the greatest experiences we had was the private island excursion. You wake up, eat a hearty breakfast, and then are picked up in a boat and whisked off to a smaller island. You are dropped off with an abundant amount of food, snorkel gear, and a cell phone. The island becomes yours for the day! A truly phenomenal and probably our best memory of our time at Six Senses.   The accommodations and service are impeccable. The hosts personalities are so charming and friendly that you feel welcomed from the start of your stay. I hope to come back to‚Ä¶"

"Six Senses offered flawless service, wonderful food in a spectacularly beautiful over the ocean resort. I stayed with my daughter in a villa over the ocean. This was the most relaxing holiday in exquisite surroundings. Meals at Chill Chill, Sip Sip and the Altitude Restaurant were all fabulous with the barbeque sea food night being a standout. This place has plenty of activity or you can retreat to your own bubble. It is a long way to travel from Australia and the journey was uncomfortable and exhausting with Air Asia (would you believe no food or water provided for 9 hours of travel and I couldn't buy water because I hadn't booked it before my departure - what if I had been diabetic?) but provided  you fly with a different airline, the journey is worth taking to stay in this‚Ä¶"
"Just returned from Six senses last week, service impeccable, food immaculate, but marine life fading. Naasym our GEM has been a great help. Frankly, there is absolutely nothing that a human could have done that they have not yet thought of and achieved with excellence. Our congratulation to a great management team. I have been to eight other resorts in the Maldives for the last decade or so and Six Senses does offer the best food and service by far. It would easily put Six senses amongst the best resort, if they are located elsewhere. Sadly, people travel half of the world to Maldives do expect too find prolific marine life, otherwise we may as well staying in those beaches much closer to home. Despite all those environmental protection scheme, Six senses seems to be fighting a‚Ä¶"
"We visited this hotel for our first trip to the Maldives , with our two kids (8 and 5 ) . Six senses kind of ticked the boxes for all the things we were looking for and although on the expensive side but we feel it was worth it.   We stayed in the water villas which were lovely , so private , so special , highly recommended. It was very roomy so more than enough for our family , there were two small beds in the room and our main king-sized bed. I thought it was going to be too small for all these beds but there were lots of space, the terrace was lovely with lots of space to relax and sun bath and still very private . Interiors were lovely but it is the small details that were so nice .   Having bikes ready at your accommodation was also do great , kids loved having their bikes‚Ä¶"
The whole experience that the Six Senses resort offered was perfect for our needs. They provided privacy whilst still catering for our needs perfectly.   The food was brilliant and we would recommend attending the Lobster beach BBQ and the Around the world Champagne to name but a few! These dinning experiences are very special and should not be missed.   The snorkelling was great and although the house reef has been bleached it still provides a well stocked sea life.   We stopped in an over the water pool villa on Jetty 3 - villa 69 at the end with uninterrupted views of the ocean - it was very private and just perfect.   The Yoga classes in the pavilion were very good with the sound of the gently lapping sea below - nothing has compared to them back home since!   Although we‚Ä¶

It is expensive, but it is worth it."
"We back to the Maldives every other year. So far we have been to 3 different top island and we choose six sense for our fourth and honeymoon visit without any hesitation.   We are rustic chic fan of the Maldives resort so the island we have been are Gili Lankafushi, Constance Moonfushi and Six Sense (back 2013). All water villas.   We think six sense ranked overall best rustic chic among Maldives, considering value for money, villa quality, food standard, service and house reef experience. Below will provide some in-depth comparison around these perspective.   1: location Some people think a big downside for six sense is the location.

"We arrived for a 5 nights stay and were wowed by how beautiful the place was. We enjoyed a snorkeling trip, fishing trip, escorted snorkel in house reef, massages, swimming, snorkeling, cycling, relaxing, restaurants and bars. There are plenty of other activities on the island too. For a small island there is a great range of restaurants/bars with high quality food, drinks and service. The snorkeling trip was well worth it, we saw a huge range, size and colour of fish, coral and turtles. In the house reef there was also a great range of fish and eagle rays. The staff are friendly and always wanting to help. Bicycles are provided for each villa to make getting around the island quick and easy but you can easily walk. The vials are well appointed included quite a well stocked mini‚Ä¶"
"If Paradise should ever be placed on earth we are pretty sure it would be on Six Senses Laamu. The location with reef just at your fingertips from Chill Bar, the concept of creating a sublime experience, where you feel nothing else looked after 24/7 by staff, GEM's, kitchen and waiters makes Six Senses the most perfect place to have a vacation.  What ever your wishes or needs are, Six Senses goes the extra mile to fullfill this for you.   We have now been there 2 times and the time between our vacations not a day or week has gone by where we have not talked about ""remember how Maji did his palm origami figures and the excelent service he provided"" or ""How our GEM Ali suited every need we had"". ""Remember when we went to Longitude and Djava (First Lady of Six Senses) always met us‚Ä¶"
"The most amazing place, the most amazing resort and the best service I have ever experienced   The only down fall is the length of the trip from Australia (perth to Singapore, Singapore to male, overnight stay in male , internal flight to the main island near the resort, boat transfer to resort )"
"This was our second trip to the Maldives.  All the luxury you want without the fuss.  Relaxed, enjoyable the staff are very accommodating without being intrusive.  Highly recommend Six Senses Laamu.  The food is exceptional and so is the service.  You can do as little or as much as you want.  The accommodation is very private and spacious. "
"We visited Six Senses Laamu for our honeymoon in March. The Maldives are a paradise destination on their own with their turquoise waters, white beaches, amazing underwater life, but the choosing the right hotel plays a very important role in your experience because you will be spending all of your time in the hotel/island.  Six Senses Laamu makes you feel right from the start at home and relaxed with their no-shoes policy, from the moment you step off the boat on arrival. Although walking barefoot at noon is no easy feat, because the sand/earth/wood is scorching hot. The design of the hotel is eco-friendly and traditional and it fits perfectly with the environment, which also adds to the relaxed and easy going feeling you have. Also the staff is perfect at setting you at ease‚Ä¶"
"What an unbelievable experience we have had at Six Senses. This is an amazing resort for couples and families.  We have currently stayed at Six Senses for 4 nights, with 3 nights remaining in over the sunset water villa on Jetty A. With Six Senses, we have been given a private concierge called Guest Experience Manager (GEM). If we have any requests we can contact our GEM directly, which is very handy. The room is really beautifully designed and the size is much bigger than the average room size in Maldives. Lots of food options, activities for all and entertainment for kids within the resort. Great service from friendly staff members (from kitchen to water sport center) and from dedicated resort host. There are several restaurants on the island offer variety type of food from‚Ä¶"

The place is beautiful, the service exceptional, lodgings very comfortable, food spectacular, all in a laid-back atmosphere and environmentally-friendly. Highlight to our Guest Experience Manager, Auzam, who was very attentive whilst respecting our privacy. Surely recommend Six Senses! "
"We are big fans of the Maldives. Since 2006 we've been to many islands so we know what to expect and we can compare objectively. Previously we stayed at One and Only Kanuhura, Conrad Rangali, Olhuveli, Meerufushi, FIlitheyo, Banyan Tree, Niyama Per Aqum, Como Maalifushi, Reethi Beach, Amari Haavoda and Furaveri.  We traveled with our 7 years old daughter and I was in my second trimester.  TRANSFERS - everything went well and smooth, no delays. Their representatives will meet you and will guide you every step of the way. Check-in was very quick and pleasant.  VILLA - one of the best we've ever stayed at. We chose a water villa (jetty A, the best one IMHO as you can sit outside on the terrace of your villa sipping bubbly and watching the most beautiful sunsets - every day!). Our‚Ä¶"
"We enjoyed the service, the kitchen, the atmosphere of the island, silence, and comfort. It is sad that we have not seen any turtles but we hope to see them next time we arrive. We wish you to save and keep that atmosphere of comfort. "
"Best experience ever! Staff were so sensitive and so caring, as if they adopted you. We felt like there was ONLY US in the entire resort because it felt like it was such a tailor made trip, so bespoken for us that it felt so exclusive! Everthing was organized smoothly, timing and every single staff knew exactly what to say and do. Everyone was informed and you could see and feel the great team work behind it! "
"We just LOVED this resort. Luxury delivered with such great, understated taste. Love the ""eco"" approach.   There is nothing pretentious or flashy about Sixth Senses.   The spa treatments were amazing, the food great (we have specific dietary requirements and they catered for us amazingly well) the wine list was extensive with both reasonable and more lavish options.    The rooms are spacious and ours (along the jetty) had an amazing all round ocean view.   The reef was fine for us as we just like to have a splash around and look for Nemo! I am unsure if it is extensive for a more accomplished diver.   We went just out of season and there was hardly anyone else at the resort which we really liked but if you like to make friends I would go in high season!  We will most certainly‚Ä¶"
"It's a long journey from Australia but worth every minute of the trip.   On Arrival you are allocated a Guest Experience Manager who will look after all your needs and sort any issues you may have, not that I suspect you will have any.  We had an overwater villa with a pool at the end of the jetty. You get your own bikes for transport around the resort and everything is within easy riding distance. We were there for seven nights and that was probably a perfect time.  The resort caters for both couples and families, yet it is never crowded or noisy and the kids have a great kids club as well as safer snorkeling areas  The villas are air conditioned and spacious with great outdoor decks and the water is perfect, there is plenty of sea life to see from the villas let alone snorkel‚Ä¶"
"The Six Senses Hotel is the most accommodating, thoughtful and lovely place I've ever been to. We had a change of plans during our cruise and unexpectedly stayed there for 3 nights. They took care of absolutely everything for us. "
"This is a fabulous resort to just relax, all the luxury without the pretentiousness that you sometimes get (no shoes not even at dinner).  I was a bit confused about the transfer before we arrived, it was strange leaving someone else to book us connecting flights but everything went well even after our flight was delayed.   Lots of amazing restaurants to choose from, all with an original concept. Our favourite was Zen the Japanese. We were on half board so our dinner was included each night but it was so easy. (You could choose 3 courses. Ie 2 starters and a main) and at anything like the beach BBQ you get a $100US credit to use each. (Same thing at Zen but we couldn't spend it all, it would have been too much food).   We did the Asian buffet one night and that was like a show‚Ä¶"
"Our stay (15nights) we felt was split in two halves, pre and then during the Easter implosion. The first 10 days were very good, amazing staff, food and service was as you would expect but then the occupancy rose and it all started to slip which for a resort of this calibre was such a shame as primarily the kitchens couldn't cope with the increased headcount. Putting that aside SSL is a lovely Island it's concept for sustainability is what other resorts should follow. Special mention for The Dive Op, DJ Des and Moses (most important man on the Island)! Would we go back probably not but for those considering a stay the Island is extremely family friendly and located in an unspoilt Atoll. "
"Unbelievable location, resort and service!!  From being greeted by the GM of the resort on arrival - to the subsequent assignment of your own GEM (guest experience manager) there isnt a single thing I could fault during our 5 night stay. Even the pricing is fair given that you cant take your own alcohol in to the Maldives (Muslim country) and that you are a captive consumer at the resort.  We stayed in the over water bungalows and they are amazing, heaps of living space including a huge front deck that opens on to the crystal clear turquoise waters. Swim straight from the ocean to the stairs that lead up to the outdoor bathroom (privacy ensured by a wooden screen) with a see-through bath that looks down to the ocean floor.  Free, non-motorised water sports/snorkeling gear.‚Ä¶"
"The location is perfect! Very nice villa's and service in general. However, I don't recommend a set dinner at Sip Sip restaurant. It's over 300USD per couple and the portions are much smaller than in Chill bar f.e. The food tastes good but if you really hungry you will not feel that you full after that dinner.  Another thing that made me give 4 stars is I saw a rat, twice around Sip Sip and SPA! Scary to me! I let our GEM know about it. Not sure what was the follow up. We also had a wedding planned at the resort. Well, originally we wanted the beach wedding. We were concern about the weather so we contacted the organizer earlier and he said they booked 3 days for us so we could choose one and be safe with the weather. That was nice. When we came to the place we chose Sandbak‚Ä¶"
"It is hard for me to find the right words about this place... You can find amazing food in one of the restaurants (sushi restaurant is my personal favorite though), you can even listen to the amazing music dj's are playing in Chill Bar whist drinking a signature cocktail, you can snorkel or dive in the amazing waters, you can just walk around without shoes (no shoe policy is amazing) and feel free!  Amazing activities, spa, massage, gym... Not to mention the stuff! Always smiling and right there whenever you need them in order to make your stay a unique experience. Concerning to the accommodation, you can expect nothing less than the perfect villa. Clean, private and quiet. It is the best place on earth for someone to spent some quality time away from the everyday madness. I‚Ä¶"
"My guilty pleasure is staying at 5 star hotels and so although the property is a very beautiful one with really interesting features such as bikes for each guest to explore the island and a ice cream parlor as well as a seamless airport transport, the obvious flaws in the on site ""gem"" services marred the trip for us.  Execution has to be perfect.  I do not like to have to repeat requests or make sure tasks get completed when I am on vacation.  Unfortunately that was our experience, hence the 4 stars."
"This is the best holiday destination/accommodation we have stayed in and significantly better than The Shore in Phuket and Rayadavee in Krabi. The staff are first class from the team who meet you with the speedboat to your GEM ( Sato is a star) and every single employee. Courtesy and a very high level standard of service are the norm. The food is very, very good though alcohol is also very expensive e.g. 4 Tiger beers plus 2 G&Ts about ¬£60! The ocean side is a little windier than the sheltered lagoon-side but, in our opinion, more beautiful. A very 'grown up' resort expertly managed with care and attention for all guests a priority. "
Firstly to get to this Hotel its wonderfully organised. You are met in Male by a Six Senses Rep who takes you to a lounge while he checks you into the next leg which is a short stunning flight of 30 mins. When you arrive you are then met again with all the bags being taken care of and you walk a few yards to a waiting boat-again beautifully organised with water and cold towels for the short but very scenic boat trip across to the island.  Once arrived on the Island the GEM does a quick show of whats what and then to the room. We had a Lagoon Beach Villa with Pool which was very very cleverly designed and frankly faultless. The rooms here are all stunning having had a look also at the Water Villa's.  The food here is also equally impressive-all food was absolutely delicious and‚Ä¶
"My wife and I stayed in the Lagoon Pool Villa for 3 days. An Ocean over water villa for 1 day and a Laamu water villa with pool for the remaining 5 days. The Beach villa was private and very nice indeed. The Ocean water villa was exactly the same floor plan inside and had a deck upstairs. Wasn't as private as it was around the middle of Jetty A. The Laamu water villa with pool was on Jetty C. It was absolutely amazing. Private, magnificent views and right at the end of the Jetty.  We have visited many luxury hotels in some stunning locations including Bora Bora, The Cook Islands, The Datai in Langkawi ETC. Six Senses Laamu is by far the best. The location is simply stunning.

"We are from Sydney and had the pleasure of visiting Six Senses Laamu for 10 days from 18/12/2015 to 28/12/2015 in the Ocean Beach Villa 97. I did not write this review immediately afterwards as I wanted to take a few more holidays to experience what it is like travelling with two young children (which we did not do previously).   We spent all 4 school holidays during 2016 on tropical resorts which appear ""comparable"" on paper around Australia, Fiji and even New Caledonia. However, we can say that Six Senses is by far the best family holiday (or perhaps any holiday) ever. Spending Christmas on the island was also magical.

"Six Senses Laamu was out 1st stop on an amazing 2 week Island Hopping tour of the Maldives. After having travelled almost 20 hours from door to door (UK to Maldives) we were welcomed with broad smiles, a cold towel and the most relaxing atmosphere one can imagine! Laamu has something for everyone and you will never feel hungry with all the great food being presented in the different restaurants. Whether you are travelling as a couple, a group of friends or a family - everyone is welcome and will have the time of their life at this resort! Thank you for everything Laamu and we will definitely be back one day!"
"This resort is remote but a quick connecting flight from Male & a 20min boat ride it is worth the extra travel. It was amazing form the time we got onto the boat. The customer service was exceptional we couldn't fault anything. Friendly & professional staff all round. Great entertainment for kids at night & the free ice cream so delicious. The ""Robinson Crusoe"" style of the property made it feel more like a real island resort. You are assigned to your own GEM (Guest Experience Manager) to meet any of your needs 24/7. The over water villa (HUGE) was beautiful with an uninterrupted view. The outdoor shower / bath was beautiful looking at the water below. (water was amazing).

"Just back from a week at Six Senses Laamu - the best beach holiday we ever had, in one of the best resorts we ever stayed (and we do travel a lot!). Everything was really amazing, from the service of each and everyone in the staff, to the mix of relaxed yet top-quality atmosphere. We loved moving around with the bikes, plunging in the water from the room, stopping by to have a nice (and free) ice cream, and of course swimming by the house reef. If you have a chance, go out with the house marine biologist - he is a great guy who knows where the turtles hide...Well done to all for making our stay just amazing."
"Simply paradise! Really nice area, friendly and high professional staff, dellicious food, fresh and tasty fishes, interesting entertainemnt like cinema under stars, dolphine cruise, snorkeling adventure and many more. It was simply amazing time."
"One of the best holiday we have had is here. The service is excellent. The resort is just everything you need for a relaxing holiday. The food, I love how they have many restaurants to choose for and the taste is sublime. We cannot wait to be back. Thanks for a wonderful time!"
"The Six Senses group, as we have come to learn, is a very unique 5 star resort company focusing on unique locations (Asia-Pacific and Mid-East primarily, but now in Europe too), guest wellness, fitness and health, and sustainable practices at all their properties.  The Laamu resort is the only resort on this Atoll island.  In considering travel here from the USA, just keep in mind -- it's a long way, but oh so well worth it.  Our trip itinerary was: ‚Ä¢	4 flights:  LAX to NRT (Japan); NRT to SIN (Singapore); SIN to MLE; then a short 1 hour hop from MLE (Male, Maldives) to KDO (Kadhdhoo, Maldives), the closest Atoll airport to the resort ‚Ä¢	30 min speed boat ride from KDO to the resort itself ‚Ä¢	The hop from/to MLE and KDO and the speed boat ride are coordinated with the resort‚Ä¶"
"Let me start by saying that this is my first review of anything, ever. I felt compelled to right this review because our experience was that amazing at Six Senses Laamu. My girlfriend and I came here all the way from NYC and wanted a relaxing 5 days after a few days in Dubai. The hotel did not disappoint in anyway. I have been back home for a week now and I still think of the hotel and our experience every day. The topline is the views are amazing, the staff is fantastic (especially our GEM Mafaz!), the food & drink are great, and the room was extremely nice. Obviously the weather is out of their control but it was perfect the entire trip, sunny and high 80s. A more lengthy description is below but trust me, stop looking and book this hotel.

"Despite the long flight (I would recommend for short stays Business, or any stay longer than 10 days Economy as it takes some time to recover & relax) once at SS, it was pure unadulterated bliss.  We went for 10 days and we had wished we stayed for longer, cause the place is paradise. How people can say they'd get bored doing nothing beats me, but here you simply melt into the island.  Our water villa was amazing, views, comfort, styling, top notch.  The report has a 'No Shoe' policy, basically once on the island (no other resort is based there) you can walk around bare foot till you leave  The dress code is very relaxed. We usually went from the beach to the restaurant, wearing our tunics etc, it was so conducive to total chill.  Each villa were given 2 bikes so you could get‚Ä¶"
"Our trip was flawless - the staff were wonderful and facilities and food were excellent. My wife has various dietary needs that were accommodated in a very understated way, which was very welcome - the team also very generously shared their specialist recipes with her, which has proven to be a hit. We very much enjoyed spending time with the on-site astronomer, Dr Parag, the marine biology team and the sustainability team - we learned so much. And both of us tried diving for the first time, which was a big achievement, given one us suffers from claustraphobia. We both felt that we got so much more out of the trip even than we had anticipated before we arrived - we were only there 24 hours before we were planning when we could get back and bring our kids (14 and 12).

"Picking a hotel in the Maldives is no easy task with so many great options.  For our family, the Six Senses was the perfect choice because we wanted the convenience of a great house reef and a nearby surf break.  Some of the  resorts with a surf break require you to book through a surf company and the entire vacation appears to revolve around surfing.  In our case, my husband just wanted to catch a few waves but we were not necessarily looking for a surf trip.  At the Six Senses, you can simply head to the water sports area and rent a board either hourly, daily or weekly (I think it was around $45 for 2 hours, $80 for the day) and they also provide free SUPs and kayaks.    We are big fans of the Six Senses concept, which I would describe as relaxed luxury.  You take your shoes‚Ä¶"
"My wife and I were hopeful of this honeymoon trip in Feb and it certainly did not disappoint.  Having been to another resort in Maldives during Aug 2014, my wife and I were really glad that we did not encounter much rain (just 1 night in fact for a couple of hours) this time around. Weather plays a really big part in whether you can enjoy outdoor activities in Maldives since we endured 5 days of continuous rain back then.  We were assigned a friendly GEM (Guest Experience Manager) the moment we arrived. A big shoutout to Shane :) She helped us to arrange for change of bicycles, arrange for reservations at the hotel among other duties. We were lucky she managed to secure reservations at the more popular restaurants after other guests cancelled theirs. Would certainly recommend to‚Ä¶"

We just wish we could afford to go back year on year a truly exceptional and unforgettable place.   Congratulations on winning the top award from trip advisor for 2017.   Thank you Martyne and Adulla our Guest Experience Maker"
Excellence service from the very moment we touch down at Male airport. Everyone staff at Six Senses Laamu are really friendly and make you feel at home. We had a great and relaxing time there enjoying the beautiful water villa and sea view. Food at the restaurant was great too! We hope to be back to this paradise again one day. 
Just spent a week here as part of a birthday celebration. With no preconceptions about Maldives let alone this resort. A long way taking 3 planes and a speed boat to finally arrive to a really friendly welcome. With shoes gone for the week we were assigned our GEM ( guest experience maker) who was absolutely superb (Georgy). Whatever we wanted to do was sorted for us. We stayed in one of the beach properties very spacious with our own pool and two steps to the beach which for the main was deserted. Snorkelling was amazing as was the evening dolphin cruise. Choice of restaurants appeared limited but the food everywhere was fresh and very well thought out. With Cinema on the beach or in the jungle for a late film there was not time to be bored. Undoubtably the most relaxing break‚Ä¶
"This is our tenth visit to the Maldives.   We were Kanuhura stalwarts, loving every grain of sand. When, to our dismay, it closed for refurbishment two years ago, to we had to chose another island, which was good enough but not quite.... that falls under a different review.   We thought we would return to Kanuhura this year but having put their prices up considerably, we concluded that we were perhaps no longer the sort of clientele they wished to attract   We therefore had to pick another resort and opted for Six Senses Laamu.   We had previously been put off this resort as it is not accessed by seaplane transfer from Mala but an internal flight and then a speed boat. However our travel agent assured us all would work like clockwork.   Our BA flight was delayed 3 hours because‚Ä¶"
"Wonderful staff, excellent rooms, top notch restaurants, extremely family-friendly. Special thanks to the staff at the Den for taking such good care of our little ones. We will definitely be back soon."
"Outstanding trip for our 25th wedding anniversary. From the first minute at the airport with a warm welcome from the staff to the last minute of our stay and departure from the airport, the staff has been adorable and made always sure we had a great time. Diversity of food and quality is outstanding. We much appreciated the ""behind the scenes"" tour which reveals how the resort works and deals with an eco-friendly/self sustainable concept. The location is perfect as you won't be disturbed by air or water traffic. A beautiful resort with 5 star service. Many thanks to all for this Wonderfull stay (too short unfortunately)"
"We stayed at this resort for our honeymoon. Our first day was spent thinking that we died in a plane crash and woke up in heaven! The resort is simply amazing, where one cannot let go off his/her camera because everywhere you look is so beautiful.   The food is very good in all restaurants. Make sure to have spend one evening at The Leaf, and also enjoy Sip Sip's pizza. Bar tenders are top notch, making the best cocktails we had in a long while.   The sea is breathtaking. You do not need to go anywhere for snorkeling, other than the Chill Bar's beach. It is just amazing.   We stayed in a water villa with pool. It was a sunrise villa, which I highly recommend because you will already enjoy the sunset in a restaurant or the beach; better enjoy the sunrise in the room.   We spent a‚Ä¶"
"Where to begin... It was hard making a decision on where to stay during our trip to the Maldives. When we started look at our options, we just became more and more confused/overwhelmed. In trying to narrow it down Six Senses Laamu was in our top three list, but how did we decide to choose it in the end? Well it came down to two things one they were quick and friendly responding to my email queries and secondly based on recommendation from a relative. We recently stayed here in an overwater villa for 7 nights during for our honeymoon.From arriving at Six Sense Laamu by the transfer you are greeted by numerous staff members and introduced to your GEM (guest experience manager) who takes care of your needs during your entire stay. They show you all aspects of the resort and are at‚Ä¶"
"We spent 9 wonderful days in this part of paradise. Everything is perfect, the room, the view, the food, the seabed and other small multicolored fish, and especially the staff (special mention to Karim the wine waiter, and also to all the others, who are incredibly nice ). Cherry on the pie, the Six Senses is eco (zero plastic or almost) and consequently really nature respectful. This place makes you forget where you come from and put you in a state of absolute fullness. If you are looking for an idyllic place to rest, to dive and discover incredible seabed, snorkeling, relaxing yourself, then this place is for you. I will go back there. When? I do not know, but I will return, soon if possible."
"Best holiday ever. The food was excellent. First we had an ocean water villa, the overater lamu villa. Both were very nice. The change was like having longer holidays. The staff was really good in service and very friendly and nice people. WE were lucky to be there for one week."
"We stayed at this resort for our 20th anniversary.  Most of the research led us to believe that this was a resort aimed at couples.  We found this not to be the case.  There were many large families with very very loud children.  This resort bills itself as a laid back resort.  They take your shoes away when you board the boat to the resort.  You are assigned a G.E.M. (Guest Experience Maker) upon arrival.  Ours was named Rishal.  He was competent for the most part.  Upon arrival he took us for a tour of the main venues of the resort.  There were not enough buggies to drive us around, so he had us walk barefoot all over the hot decking and beach.  By the time we finally got around to the jetty where our villa was located my feet felt like they were on fire.  It was so bad that‚Ä¶"
"Have recently returned from 9 nights at this resort. The weather and scenery was amazing which is always a good start but we were very impressed with the whole Six Senses vibe- Robinson Crusoe chic with excellent facilities and superb food. The level of service was perfect for us, extremely efficient and friendly without being too overbearing. Our GEM Mafaz was just lovely and we actually looked forward to our daily chat with him as he was extremely proud and knowledgeable about his country. Would highly recommend this resort for couples and families with older children."
"It's now one month ago since my wife and I returned from our fourth vacation to Six Senses Laamu and we still dream about this place which truely is paradise on earth. The resort fully lives up to it's name. It's all about your senses and getting peace in your mind. The incredibly frindly staff (special thank's to Auzam!), the gastronomical experiences including the homemade delicious icecream, the soft and exceptional maldivian weather, the spa's, the snorkling over amazing reefs with beautyfull reefsharks, seaturtles and colorfull fish, the deep black nigths with tons of stars shining back on you, the meditation courses ... it all adds up to a very special experience which is far, far more than ""just"" a luxury vacation. Highly recommended if you are looking for a vacation‚Ä¶"
"We wanted a winter week in the sun. We wanted to relax, to snorkel and we wanted to be left alone to enjoy some privacy. Six Senses Laamu delivered on all accounts. I would highly recommend this resort to anybody, I cannot think of a reason that anyone would not love it. "
"Room, ocean villa, amazing, spacious, attention to details. Staff was fantastic. The island is just like paradise and I enjoyed riding the bicycle through it. Options for dining and with superb views. Beach cinema every night. Free Ice cream."
"We had our most memorable holiday at Six Senses Laamu ‚Äì just superb! It was an idyllic getaway: the breathtaking scenery, the crystal clear water, the impeccable service, the awesome food, the tranquil environment ‚Ä¶ We were just top of the world.  We can‚Äôt wait to come back."
"Our 3rd visit to the Maldives was outstanding. Highlights: Food (especially for vegans) Staff Sealife Gym Villa  Whilst so much was good, the delicious and inventive vegan food was extraordinarily good and easily the best we have experienced while on holiday. It is no exaggeration to say we had a five/six course meal each night that would have been at home in a high end restaurant anywhere. Breakfast was no less wonderful with a comprehensive buffet to choose from as well as an a la carte menu. Once again we were offered a special vegan option or two every day. This resort really is a haven for vegans (food for carnivores all looked fantastic too]. Special thanks to Raheem and Meenaj and all their staff.  The holiday really started as the seaplane beached on the sand and we‚Ä¶"
"This has to be one of the most incredible places on the planet! From the moment we arrived and were welcomed by the staff, to the moment we departed we were pampered and taken care of.  We were upgraded to a pool villa, meaning that we had our own pool in our terrace above the ocean! What an experience!  Ayurveda massages, yoga classes and meditations, were just some of the activities that enhance our stay. Swimming and diving in such paradise, looking at the sky at night, enjoying their food, relaxing at the beach or in our room, or biking in the island was incredible.  The hotel staff, from France, to Marteyne, to our GEM Rishal, to Laura, Dr. Jitendra, to pool bartenders, waiters, etc.. were very attentive and contribute greatly to the magic of the place. My gratitude to all‚Ä¶"
"Best vacation ever! Beautiful surroundings, beautiful under water life, great food and great service. Wish that we one day will be back. Love the barefoot principal. Good trips. Very good accommodation!"
"This is the most beautiful holiday destination we have ever been to. The attention to detail, the food, the service and the location are all top notch. You pay a premium for this resort and they do not disappoint. From the waiters, chefs, roof service staff and facilities like the Dive Centre. We cannot fault anything we have experienced here. Well done Six Senses. "
"Oh what a holiday! Oh what a diving!  Six Senses Laamu is by right one of the best resorts in Maldives and one of the best resorts globally experienced so far. Highly luxurious villas built with exquisite taste hovering above turquoise lagoon. Shining white sand under emerald trees. Drinks and food that can satisfy every taste. Shining smiles of the people who are running this fantastic facility. While just in minutes of sailing, the depth of the ocean hides immense variety of life and landscape which can probably suit a high budget sci-fi movie. My warmest gratitude goes the personal guest entertainment manager assigned to me Georgiy Bizyukov, the true wine expert Moise (Moses) Apple and the resident magician Dr Vinod, who contributed so much to my holiday. And of course,‚Ä¶"
From the minute we arrived to the time we unfortunately departed our experience was second to none. Having been before we knew some of the staff and it was great to see them again.  Arif our GEM was so helpful and sorted out every need down to ice and lime delivered at 5.00pm for our G and T!  Yazeed provided an excellent cookery class and Magid along with the The Leaf guys were fantastic and we were spoilt rotten.  Cannot wait to return again. 
"Having been to the island before we did  worry that it may not live up to the wonderful holidays we have had there in the past - however if anything this was the best 8 nights we have ever had. The service is second to none. Our GEM, Yasir - nothing was too much trouble - The spa was wonderful we had two couples massages. Free ice creams - more than 40 flavours to select from !!!! We both dive and enjoyed 5 great dives  - with Yves and Margherita our guides/ intructors saw sharks, lots of turtles, sting ray - and we now know what a ghost pipe fish looks like ( thanks to Mark). Mohammed Ali at the leaf restaurant and his team need a very special mention the food is amazing and they make such a fuss of you. The chief made a special meal for us and combined all our favourite foods.‚Ä¶"
"Six Sense Lamu Wonderful bedrooms, turquoise water and beautiful island ! It was really great, clean with awsome GEM ( Guest Experience Maker) and whole area, beach.. The pool was marvellous and  Food was excellent and the waiters were really nice and always ready... In the ice cream point There were the most talkative and friendly girl ( Abe) and we would like to thank our GEM Sato, he was always helpfull. It was really the best holiday ever"
"I would not hesitate to visit this resort again, although we visited when the Maldives was catching the edge of a hurricane and saw more rain than sun.  Wonderful rooms, great food, excellent staff - but very pricy spa.  The only downside is that the resort is a further domestic flight from Mal√©, and I feel that there is a good offering of equivalent resorts that you can get to by speedboat or  seaplane and therefore avoid the extended travelling time. It seems easy when you are booking but in reality when you get off an overnight flight you just don't want to go into airport transfer and start all over again. "
"Incredible, stunning, heaven.. words are not enough to describe this holiday. The villas are amazing but what makes it are the staff who are truly incredible at what they do..You must visit here at least once to say you have done it."
"SixSensesLaamu is a magic place. No Shoes, No Time, different time Zone, No noise. Amazing Landscape. Live a Water Villa experience and Ocean Villa you will be in paradise. Perfect for an honeymoon. The personel is sweet and well trained to give you un unforgettable experience. Thank you to all staff and Yassir. We suggest to you Vietnamit food and Leaf Restaurant.  ‚ù§üåøüçÄ  "
"Our 10th visit to this amazing country and we've got a clear winner: Six Senses Laamu!!! That's the place we really mean to go back to. What the talented and experienced GM of this enchanting property has achieved is impossible to compare with and probably replicate in other island resorts. Do not expect high spec villas del concrete or any parade of Michelin star European chefs‚Äé, fashion shows at breakfast, golf courses or spas on separate islands or whatever is the latest fad in the Maldivian uber-lux space. Instead you'll be treated like a celebrity, as if the whole resort was for you only. Low-key and laid-back. No buggies left and right but bicycles. Incredible variety of healthy lunch/cucina alta dinner choices; incomparable diving/snorkling conditions right in the house‚Ä¶"
"We were a party of 10 from all ages and we all found something to do. We stayed on the beautiful water villas which are extremely spacious loving the outdoor shower and bath area. Because they are so environmentally friendly, all their buildings blend beautifully with the vegetation and the sea. Staff are very helpful, beautifully presented. Having the bicycles with your initials gave the holiday a very fun touch. Food was surprisingly good and great variety. Seeing the dolphins and turtles and having drinks out in the sandbank made this a holiday of a life time."
"We had a fantastic time at Six Senses Laamu. From the minute we landed at Male airport, to the time we left, it was absolutely perfect. Our GEM, Ravah was exceptional in ensuring our experience was just as we liked, and the resort was really a slice of paradise. From the amazing views that greeted us from our secluded villa overlooking the ocean, to the amazing food, everything was just perfect.   The complimentary ice cream station (with 40+ flavours) and the no-shoes philosophy were a nice touch, however this stay wouldn't have been as incredible as it was without the people on the island, who worked tirelessly to deliver exceptional customer service and ensure we had a fantastic stay. We'll definitely come back."
"Everything about the resort was fantastic. One of the best holidays we have been on. The water is incredible. The food, service, facilities and resort layout is the best we've seen. Would definitely recommend."
"No comment, it was all perfect. Me and my wife decide to call it island of crabs ( because of the many crabs everywhere) We love it . We spent 7 days at the beach villa and 3 days in water villa. Beautiful villas. Food were  amazing very healthy. Spa was great. Price was too high but seem that it's everywhere in Maldiveian. We might comeback "
"My boyfriend and I have travelled a huge amount before, but Six Senses Laamu tops it all - truly incredible. Just a few highlights:   - Barefoot life for a full week - from the moment you're given a little bag to put your shoes in on the speed boat to the island right to when you step back on to it.  - Beautiful villa - everything you could ask for, from scented pillows on a bed facing the ocean, to the outdoor bath and showers, raised platform to watch the sun go down with champagne, bikes with personalised number plates to cycle around the island on, and a turtles nest at the end of your path. - Wonderful food and drinks - a wide selection of perfectly cooked food (lobster BBQ, sushi, Maldivian curries (which we asked for the recipe for), and of course - the incredible‚Ä¶"
"I have been looking forward to see this piece of paradise. I personally loved a rustic style resort. When i get there, it exceeded my expectation due to its service and food option. I enjoyed the Asian night during the night of my stay. The next day, i experienced the in villa breakfast ( since i woke up late and missed the buffet ). A breathtaking view that welcomes you from your villa. The ice cream station is amazing. The staff and so great and friendly. Dont leave the island without having a spa treatment --- and dont miss not exploring the island.  I wish of coming back!  P.S. Thank you by the way for my birthday cake ( i left it on the fridge though as i was so full from the Asian buffet -- no worries it was on Instagram )..........but i love the gesture and thank you."
"When it comes to Six Sense Lamu hotel, it is a stunning location. It is just breathtaking and we enjoyed everyday on the island!  Island was so deserted and bike rides/snorkelling was something that we loved the most.   Our villa was perfect and complementary spa treatment was just something!  Spa itself was stunning and  nothing like I have experienced before.  Service and people who are working on the island are just so lovely.  Despite that there are a few things that we were very much disappointed with.  I am a big foody and if food is bad, it ruins my holidays and sadly it was the case with Six Sense Lamu.  We went to Sip Sip and restaurant next to reception and god it was awful.  Food just had no taste or flavour. The  famous Leaf restaurant had quite limited menu and we‚Ä¶"
"We had an excellent relaxing stay. wonderful hospitality. Great selection of restaurants, each of which were fantastic. Also had a cold room with cured meats and cheeses and huge wine cellar. Best of all was another cold room with all you can eat ice cream with dozens of different flavour!"
"We stayed at the water villa with private pool. Did not feel the need to step out of the villa as it had everything we needed. Staff was attentive and well knowledged, esp the sommelier Moses who served us very good wine. Not to mention the spa was also excellent and the team has been well trained in six senses spas in other geographies."
"Six Senses Laamu needs a rating system of its own - I have reviewed properties and given them 5 stars but they still can't compare to the sheer luxury of Laamu.  We were here for 5 nights for our honeymoon and surprisingly, we ran out of time to do everything we wanted to! 7 nights seems to be ideal to fit in everything you want to do as well as relax.  Arriving at Male airport our travel agent had made an error with our booking and we couldn't catch the connecting flight. Six Senses had already arranged our flight for the next day, a night at a hotel and the transfer. We were escorted to each area and carefully looked after before we even boarded!  The resort has a no shoes policy (some spoilsports still wore shoes?!) and it instantly connects you with the eco theme of Laamu.‚Ä¶"
"Had the most magical 7 days on this island.  Service is impeccable from the moment you arrive.  Don't think we ever passed a member of staff without them smiling and greeting us.  The staff in the restaurants and bars are superb and can't do enough for you.  The accomodation (we had a water villa) was outstanding and even though the sun didn't join us for all seven days, it didn't matter one bit.  Couldn't recommend Six Senses Laamu any more.  It's the most amazing place and we were genuinely very sad to leave.  We will be going back!"
"All the reviews are true.  It might sound unbelievable to read review after review glowing about this place but they deserve it!   Our GEM Ravah was incredible and I can't think of any negatives. The water, the hospitality, the conversation with the staff, the smiles, the hellos, the bikes, the breakfast; everything was awesome.  Go and you will be glad you did."
"The entire resort is a paradise. Service is amazing and the staff are so friendly. You feel like you are the only people on the whole island! Rooms are absolutely breathtaking and are all eco-friendly but with modern luxuries. Loved every second of our stay. Only difficulty is reaching the island, unless you fork out for a yacht or sea plane you need to go through some tiny domestic airports."
"I have travelled a lot , but I have never been to a place like six senses laamu where almost everything is possible and can be done .  During our stay the hotel was not on full occupancy therefore a lot of reservations could be arranged on a short notice , they've also let us stay in one of the rooms until our evening departure .  Surprisingly we only got 2 full sunny days , the rest of the 5 days had scattered rain showers and the sky was cloudy , but you don't have control over that .  Definitely a place I would love to visit again ! "
"We cannot recommend Six Senses Laamu enough to anyone thinking of going. There is literally nothing we can fault this resort on. From the moment you are met in Male by a resort representative the service is impeccable - friendly and welcoming while also incredibly professional. I was so sad to leave the resort that I actually broke down into tears on leaving which was needless to say a little embarrassing, but it was just such a perfect experience. Our GEM (Guest Experience Maker), Afrah, was also a large part of the reason why we enjoyed our stay so much. He went out of his way everyday to ensure we had the best stay - even making alternative arrangements for us when the weather disrupted one of our planned activities. All the staff seem to love their work and the enthusiasm is‚Ä¶"
"Everything was perfect, ok a part from the trip which is a little long ;), but so worth it ones arrived!

I could write for hours but my English is not good enough for this and to put it in a gist as it comes to my head .. the welcome, organic food, the environment awareness, snorkeling, the view from the bed, to shower outside almost surrounded by water, the different restaurants.. drinks outside and inside of the chill bar, the staff .. the lobster dinner on the beach. Whilst writing this I can almost smell the different smells of the morning ride going by bicycle from jetty C to the breakfast. it was 8 days in‚Ä¶"
"WARNING: LONG REVIEW! My husband and I spent four nights at the Six Senses after a week in India, and we had the most amazing stay. Our friends had recommended this hotel after their honeymoon earlier this year and it exceeded our expectations. As first timers to the Maldives we were not ready to commit to a 7-10 night trip but if I could do it over, we would have stayed there much longer!  From the moment we arrived at Male Airport we were blown away by the service. Our incoming flight from India was delayed so we landed in a state of panic as there was only 30 minutes until our flight for Kadhdhoo departed. Once through customs we started looking around to see where domestic departures would be when we spotted a young man with a Six Senses sign. He was fully up to speed and‚Ä¶"
"You can't go to a more beautiful, more relaxing spot anywhere in the world.  It is absolute peace and beauty.  Everyone who works there is super friendly and just wants you to have the time of your life."
"We visited here on our honeymoon and it was the exquisite dream that I always imagined my honeymoon to be!  We had a villa that was at the end of the jetty with our own private pool. The room was beautifully appointed, with glass under the toilet and at the bottom of the bath so you can see the fish swimming by as you sit :)  Our GEM was so helpful, organising dinners and activities for us. The onsite scuba Centre was great, where my husband dove for the first time.  The food was amazing! The breakfast buffets in the morning were so extensive and delicious. The different dinner experiences were great- my favourite being one where we were taken out to a sand bar by boat where they set up a bar and a big table for everyone to eat together.

"Me and my husband stayed at the resort for 5 nights for our honeymoon and i had to say, it was absolutely amazing. Once we got on the hotel speedboat, we were given cold towels, folllowed by homemade lemonade and freshly cut coconut. The staff informed us that wifi is available on the boat and if our phone battery is running out, they have power banks to charge our phone!  The overwater villa we're staying in was gorgeous. Outdoor shower, glass bottomed bathtub, 2nd floor balcony, fully loaded mini bar and staircases that leads you to the sea were just WOW! The best part of the room was the ocean view. So calming and relaxing. And we were even lucky enough to see a stingray swimming away from our villa! The housekeeping guy was very professional as well. The room was kept the‚Ä¶"

"This was fabulous! The location is really natural as it is in one of the south-most islands of Maldives. Some are beach villas where you just step into the Indian ocean, and has an excellent ocean view. Some others are build on the sea.   The journey may be tiring as one has to get a one-hour domestic flight from Male international airport, and also another 15 minute speed boat ride. However, I really enjoyed the boat ride.   All the staff, including the GM are really nice and helpful. Ideal for a couple or even for a family to relax and forget about all the busy and hectic town life. You step into a completely different world!  However, I ONLY recommend this to a VERY VERY rich person...."
"Just come back from the resort and start missing it.  A 4-night stay in a over water villa in the most distant and quiet jetty C which allowed us to pass through the woods on the cycles every day which was very enjoyable.  You can see crabs, lizards right beside you!!!    The over water villa having a outdoor walk-in shower is very lovely, you can feel the sea breeze and enjoy the beautiful scenery even when you are having a shower.  The feel of the villa is exactly what we are looking and the colour of the daybed and its cushions just blend-in perfectly with the stunning sea and sky.  Food is very nice too and having a great variety, every dishes was perfect.

"As you arrive in the Maldives, you are pretty much in Paradise. Stepping into the Six Senses Resort takes that to the next level. The lay out of the resort is logistically well done. It allows one a gentle bike ride or easy walk to get between the water sports; spa; restaurants and rooms. The water sports facility was really well stocked. The equipment was more than adequate: great SUPs; surfboards and a windsurfing rig and board. The team there were very helpful and super keen to provide guests with the best water experience they could - nothing too much trouble. The spa and yoga was unbelievable. The Aerial yoga and fitness was a real treat and very well instructed. The environment really lent itself to a total unwind. I liked the Ayurveda angle, the treatments and‚Ä¶"

Aquamarine hued oceans caress this island with its own reef and a sandbank from where the sunset is an exhilarating experience. Professional dive centre,world class spa, movies under the sky, delectable cuisine,endless wine cellars,delicious ice creams ( 42 flavours to choose from and complementary !) - everything pales in front of their service.

Stunning location, the resort is incredibly well laid out, eco-friendly and guests are pampered by exceptionally friendly and thoughtful staff that make you feel cherished as a customer. Beach villas are 5 star yet have an authentic cosy feel that one would expect on an island. Reminded me of a 5 star tree house! Great diving with awesome marine biologists on staff to answer any questions. Great research being conducted and sustainable practices underway at the resort all adding to the experience and making you feel comfortable with the footprint of their operation there.

"We stays in one of the lagoon water villas early Nov. Here are the  pros and cons of the resort:  Pros: Really well laid out resort. Personal Bikes with your own villa number to stop people from taking it (Per Acquum Niyama was bad in this respect). Friendly staff who remember your names Lovely breakfast, especially french press coffee with full cream Great food at Zen (Japanese) and The Leaf. Only complaint was the soggy seaweed wrap in sushi. They need crispy wraps. A lot of food came from the organic garden. We went there to taste the vegetables which was lovely Free ice cream! Stand up paddling was great  Snorkeling was great especially around house reef  Cons: The journey from Male to Six Senses is quite a trek, especially 11:30pm local flight to Khadhoo and then a boat‚Ä¶"
"I was impressed by the beauty of the island and of the resort. Everything was perfect from the pick up at the airport to my departure. The food in the different restaurants was to die for, the spa & the yoga class facing the ocean were amazing. I was particularly moved by the kindness, availability and helpfulness of the staff. A special thanks to the GM for making my stay memorable. I will get back as soon as I have the chance."
"This is a wonderful, relaxing resort with great diving, food and service.  The on the water villas are beautiful and well appointed with glass floors in many areas that add to the beauty of the experience. The diving and snorkeling are spectacular right on the resort reef with even more options a short walk, swim or boat ride away. The food and service are top notch and it is the most beautiful seaside resort I have visited. It is also quite and relaxing with no other resorts, boats, planes or people in the way."
"Six senses laamu gave us, without doubt, the best holiday I have ever had, and after over 20 years of holidaying with our family, we have been fortunate to have stayed in some amazing places!  We stayed in a water villa over the lagoon (sunset side) with our 14 year old daughter for October half term. From the moment we arrived we were enchanted. Aesthetically the hotel is incredibly beautiful - bleached wood jetties, glass windows in the floor revealing the wonders of the pristine reef, fish chandeliers, open to the ocean wherever possible. We swam from our water villa to explore the house reef - turtles, fish of every shape and colour, eagle rays, stingrays, corals. My husband was formerly a marine biologist and he said that the reef, just 20 metres from our villa, was totally‚Ä¶"
"Went there for 5 days with 2 couples to celebrate my sweet 40, following a crazy Dubai night club blast.  This place is indescribable, starting from the island, resort, stuff, and service.  If I had the time, I would go back in a heartbeat.  Six Senses Laamu simply is, as I like to call, ""the tangible version of heaven."""

"We went on our honeymoon the end of November into the first week of December 2015.  This was a great choice for a relaxing honeymoon. The staff was wonderful and accommodating. You definitely get the ""island feel"". We were initially hesitant about walking around barefoot, however we quickly realized that the facilities were kept very clean and being barefoot really amplified the island feel. The food was wonderful although pricey, but we knew that going in. They had free ice cream everyday as much as you want which was awesome. The breakfast was incredible (which we believe is included with all stays). They had a large variety of food and we enjoyed our breakfast overlooking an amazing view. We loved that the island was e-co friendly and had their own water filtration system.‚Ä¶"
"Really wonderful place. So relaxing and peaceful. The perfect place for a honeymoon. The water villas are amazing, the staff are so pleasant and helpful, and the food is delicious. We had a fantastic time! "
Had an amazing time at Six Senses. Our time there was so relaxing and the surroundings simply stunning (marine life so close to the villa was incredible). Food was divine and the champagne dinner is highly recommended. Staff were always smiling and willing to help. We will be back.
"We have spent our honeymoon in six senses laamu and everything was just perfect. Our water villa was a dream. The hotel is perfectly integrated into nature so you have the feeling of living there not sleeping in a hotel. We really admire six senses laamu's idea of being sustainable. The way they produce their water and the way they recycle every trash is just a model to follow. We have booked the half board, I can say that their restaurants are amazing. We really enjoy the food with natural and healthy ingredients is the kind of food we love. As well, we have enjoyed with ocean dimensions. It was a pleasure to dive with you, sincerly. And for ending, I want to mention the gems. They are like personal assistants and they are in charge to ensure that your stay is gonna be perfect,‚Ä¶"
"We found the most beautiful island, the friendliest staff, an amazing spa, great food, and so many fun activities to do. ‚Äì We loved every second of our stay and will surely return to Six Senses Laamu. "
"Although it was a stormy week so we were unable to get into the sea much, we still enjoyed our stay in Six Senses.  The staff were attentive and hospitable.  Service was guest-centered.  The laamu water villa was cozy with all kinds of amenities, a nice mini bar and stereo system.  There were contingency activities on rainy days to keep guests entertained.  We love their philosophy on sustainability.  They grow their own veggies and produce their own drinking water.   It'd be better if the cost of inter-island transportation is incorporated into the rate of accommodation so that it does feel that we need to pay extra for such, as in the case of meals.  We went for half board and we were stuffed all day.  That reminds us on the free unlimited ice cream and sorbet at Ice Bar--‚Ä¶"
"We love the Maldives, the diving, the beaches, the climate, the people. We have been 15 times for family holidays and almost always picked a new island to see other parts of the various atolls, get new experiences. This time we decided to repeat for once and chose Laamu Six Senses. We had already been there 2 years ago. The most important change is the new pool area which was under construction 2 years ago. It is a very large (second largest in the Maldives) pool with nice bar and snack restaurant. To change our experience we took an OCEAN Beach Villa (next to the new pool) instead of the Sunset Water Villa we had last time. In this sense we had a total new island feeling. Here are the main pros and cons of Laamu: CONS:  1. Far away from Male (1h10min by seaplane, 35min by local‚Ä¶"
"Beautiful location with its own house reef, excellent food and very friendly personnel with an outstanding wellness spa. Water sport activities including diving center with outstanding equipment and friendly personnel. It is also an excellent place for wind and wave surfing. The kids club is also an added feature for families with children. "
The website says it all! We stayed in number 24 lagoon villa. At this time of year winds come in from ocean side so we were protected which was just as well since weather for 3 out if 6 days was cyclonic. Sun on last 3 days made a real difference to the resort.  No need to take shoes since it is a bare feet resort; not to wear shoes for a week was luxury! Food out of this world. We took half board option which was probably the right thing to have done given prices which were to be expected but high in the Chill Bar. A nice touch is free ice cream and sorbets-c.40 different flavours. Drink prices again as expected; we found an excellent Malbec- Vinecol at $40 but with 22% tax on all F&B items the bill mounts up. I do suggest the snorkel trip for the afternoon; it presents a‚Ä¶
"Had a really wonderful stay despite inclement weather. Stayed on sunrise side of jetty A (villa 24) - excellent location. View was of lagoon which was stunning and much less windy when blowing a hoolie. Villa was gorgeous - understated luxury, sexy and romantic. Food delicious although very glad we did half board as missed lunch a few times as full from breakfasts.  Zen and Leaf restaurants need booking so book before you go. We didn't go for a pool villa and again, glad we didn't as no need (unless children perhaps?) Staff superb. Nothing went unnoticed and they couldn't do enough for you. Snorkelling from villa or bar was excellent. Resort was nearly full but it never felt busy other than at breakfast but there were always plenty of seats. There were slide/video presentations‚Ä¶"
"Amazing island and villas, Super tasty and fresh food and great diving/ snorkeling!! I really fully enjoyed this place. Special Thanks to Marteyne the GM, Chef Martin for his hospitality and the Divecenter Team, who opened my eyes to the beautiful underwater world of the Maldives!!!!Don¬¥t miss out on that."
"We are a family of four (kids are 9 and 11). This was our second time at Six Senses Laamu and we are already planning our next visit. It was like home from home. We even got our personalized bike number plates this time.  Exceptionally well trained and friendly staff! They make you feel so welcome and special. GEM takes all the responsibilities in planning your stay and organizing activities. Inas was amazing! He fulfilled our every single request.  There is so much to do on the island, especially if you need your kids to be entertained. Apart from usual snorkeling, diving, spa sessions, boat trips, we loved our bike rides around the island, movie nights under the stars, visiting ice cream shop every afternoon, yoga and meditation classes. Apart from visiting Den kids club every‚Ä¶"
"We stayed at SS Laamu for a week, and were devastated to go home.  The island, staff, villas, amenities, food, wine List, spa, everything- was perfect. Such a beautiful place, so well maintained, and with the most amazingly warm, smart and proactive staff. Six Senses are amongst best in class for training staff to create an atmosphere that is so calming and relaxed, not invasive, and chic. This is our absolute Favourite destination in the Maldives, and we will visit again soon.  "
"Anyone writing a negative review on this place is one of those people that is never happy.  You have to work VERY hard to find one bad thing about this resort.  It was truly spectacular.  The setting is stunning and the villas are comfortable, clean, and very private.  The food is some of the best I've ever had.  It's creative, fresh, and just delicious.  We were full to bursting after every meal!  And the staff is amazing.  Every single person from our GEM to the maintenance staff were so kind, helpful, and friendly.  Our GEM went over the top and took us on some intimate tours of the island and the local island.  Everyone there works to remember you and by day three they were addressing us by name.  It really felt like home.   My husband and I are both scuba certified so we‚Ä¶"
"GEM Mafaz is very nice, thanks Mafaz for listening to me patiently and explain to me slowly. We really appreciate it. And every thing is great. Six Senses Laamu is very beautiul, I hope come back to Six Senses soon...."
"If there is Paradise on erth this is it. the villas is fantastic and the food is no less fantastic. and the pepol working there is amazing, they have this sence of joy in there Work and that look in the eyes , they are amazing all of them. the Island is a Whole story on its own . it is paradise on erth . we had the best time ever and took home a lot of good memories  and all of them good  it all starts when we landed in Male, you will be taken care of from you get out of the airplane til you are on the island. I will stop heer but i could make a long story. I will only say (go just go its fantastic.)"
"I think Six senses laamu is the one of the best place at Maldives for honeymoon:) everything was amazing. Rooms were awesome. I cant say anything about ocean because you wouldnt understand me without seeing it:))) before i came to maldives , me and my husband were worried about foods because we are muslim. However, at six senses laamu, you can find helal delicious foods:) furthermore, nature of hotel was also wonderful. Hotel cares about enviromental issues and you can see that everywhere. Rooms , beach ,pool , restaurants... etc.were designed to not harm nature. In brief, we love six senses laamu. I hope see you again:)  Sebla Eren Ertuƒürul, turkish couple"
"From the moment we met Amir at the INIA, helpful and friendly service of SS started. Upon arrival at the Kaddhoo airport we were greeted by our GEM Moosa and crew. With is 20 minutes we reached the resort and we were greeted by GM. It's very nice of her to meet and wish us a pleasent time in SSL. Resort setting gives you rustic natural feel. Great selection of food and drinks.  No concrete beauty yet it's gorgeous. Leaf restaurant with its own salad/leaf garden is brilliant idea. Over water FNB outlets makes you very relaxed during your meals, specially during breakfast(so much of good food with some live stations) 50 shades of blue... simply stunning. I like to high light some of the team member who did really good job and make us feel so welcome. GEM Moosa Chef Nadheem  Chef‚Ä¶"
"Amazing hotel for couples and families, enjoyed the spa and the amazing activities. The food is delicious and the staff are friendly.  We booked the lamu water villa it is private and comfortable. The transportation to the island was easy"

"Everything was perfect! The service was exceptional, the food was outstanding, the surroundings were amazing and in total it was at least a five star experience. For sure a destination you would like to spend your honeymoon on..."
"As a person that has traveled extensively for business as well as pleasure and stayed in the best hotels in the world, I can say that Six Senses Laamu surprised me in a very pleasant way.  It was actually BETTER than advertised or expected.  No one that knows me can beleive it.  But yes this resort is really a 7 Star resort and simply has no competitioon once you have been there.   The service, the attention to detail and the complete privacy is awe inspiring.   "
"Every staff member's welcoming smile and attention to detail made our stay at Six Senses the most enjoyable experience I've had to date. We felt pampered with the little touches not going unnoticed. Nothing was too much trouble and that's what a holiday is all about, for a brief moment in your life total relaxation can occur! The water front villa invited us into an amazing private sanctuary that allowed complete relaxation to occur."
"Firstly we have to apologise in the delay in writing this long review to commend this resort but moreover its incredible staff, but that's what happens when back in the real world and busy life takes over.... We travelled there almost a month ago (sadly) for our 14 night honeymoon.  The only drawback on arrival was the wait for the domestic connection but we were met with kindness and professionalism from the start.  We had listened to previous suggestions about booking certain restaurants and were amazed to find that our restaurant booking at Zen on night 1 was changed to accommodate for our later arrival.  Our first sign as to how great a trip this was going to be.  Our GEM Hollow was just fantastic, firstly he had sorted out our dinner arrangements, then he informs us we've‚Ä¶"
"Fantastic resort, fantastic staff. Absolutely outstanding. We have stayed there one week, but next time we will surely stay more. From the Island, to the facilities, to the staff, it has given us an enormous pleasure and relaxing stay."
"We went for my partner's 50th birthday  Absolutely wonderful place with beautiful eco- friendly surroundings  The food, the service - everything was exceptional  A place to relax/chill out and have some spa treatments or for the more adventurous there are a number of water sports and excellent snorkelling and diving if so inclined "

"This resort is heaven on earth! We are a family of 6 (all adults) and stayed in two ocean villas (3 adults each) for 5 days 4 nights. It was off peak in Sept but the weather was good to us with only slight drizzling one of the nights. We booked a 'Stay four nights with complimentary half board' via Agoda.com. The rate includes daily buffet breakfast and dinner, which I think it works well for us. The airport transfer was organised really well. We stayed overnight in Hotel Jen in Male capital on our first night (we arrived in the evening), the staff in Hotel Jen pick us up and drop us off to the Six Senses staff at the airport the following day. We took a seaplane to Six Senses and stopover at Niyama Resort for refuel. The journey took an hour but the view was really good and we‚Ä¶"
"Best choice to choose this resort if you would like to recharge your energy. The Six Senses Laamu is great for relaxing time away from the office. We stayed 3 nights in September 12-15, 2016. We really impress of all staff service mind and feeling excite with any environment that really clean.   We think here's the best resort of Maldives that you must be here! Overall a wonderful stay, will certainly to aim visit again.  Kanchana & Pariwat"
"I have nothing bad or even average to comment on Six Senses Laamu. The island is ridiculously beautiful, the villas are large, comfortable, well decorated, the staff is super nice, kind and careful to all your needs, everyone smiles all the time. Food is great, restaurants are super nice. It is the perfect place to relax. I want to go every year, it is like paradise on earth! the sea is so transparent and you can do snorkelling very close to the coast. I don't dive, but can imagine how wonderful it is for diving!  Also, my husband is a surfer and he enjoyed awesome waves there. There are spots you can paddle in and other ones that require a boat ride, which are charged apart (around $50 per day).  Best vacations ever."
"Lovely island, well kept, and well managed resort. Domestic flight to the resort was delayed so journey felt a bit long but on the way back it was just fine so guess it depends ! GEM nice, professional, efficient but there's a tendency towards telling you what you can and cannot do, which is tiresome on holiday. Still it was meant nicely, no doubt. Calling the Gem is like calling reception elsewhere; at Laamu you call the Gem, that's all, and he's your only access to whatever you may need that's not otherwise available in the room : if you need to book a restaurant, if you'd like skimmed milk for coffee in the room instead of the full milk that's in the fridge; or to get your departure details sorted out. His job is to make sure you're happy and have all you need. I have to say,‚Ä¶"
"This is our 5th stay at this amazing resort & it keeps getting better each year. Too many wonderful people to name them all, everyone in the 4 restaurants, chill bar, sip sip pool bar, dive shop & surf shop are all so lovely & helpul & lots of fun to chat to, such a great sense of humour.  Things that we didn't think could get better have, such as Leaf Restaurant, the spa, the wellness & fitness program & the surf team. Thanks for a wonderful stay & thanks to the GM for the upgrade!! If you want experience the Maldives at their best, you have to go here."
It really looked like everything was made locally. The whole environment was very relaxing and all smiley faces.  The food was excellent. All 5 star restaurants.  Our GEM (Guest Excellence Manager) made sure that we had a vacation just as we wanted it. 
"Six senses is the most beautiful place in the world. Everything was amazing, the food, the champagne dinners, the lobster beach bbq and the service. Our gem, personal assistant on the island, took care of everything. Strongly recommend the overwater bungalow with half board. The bungalow was incredible even with turtles swimming off the back. The scuba diving is unbelievable with great reefs and manta rays. A must go honeymoon or special occasion destination. Do not be put off with the transfers as it is well worth it and six senses take care of everything."
"Simply the best resort we have ever been to. Perfect service, state of the art cuisine in all restaurants, spacious, functional, lavishly decorated villas. Absolutely memorable. The best honeymoon we could ever wish for."
"Super awsome holidays, especially all the activities s.a. diving, surfing, yoga,... Food: Super excellent, especially the Breakfast and the zen restaurant. I don't understand any negative food reviews. I also enjoyed that there were complimentary activities,... in other words that you didn't have to pay for every tiny little bit extra. Bonus: Ice cream is for free. "
"Everything about this resort is amazing. The accommodation, the service, the food, the water colour, the surfing, the snorkelling, the excursions, the staff. This will now be the yard stick to what we compare all our holidays to. Perfect for honeymooning couples. Make sure you take advantage of the complimentary classes at the spa/gym.   The treatments at the spa are also wonderful.   We would recommend going to the lobster bbq one night and the cinema under the stars.   Thank you to our GEM Abdullah, although we didn't seek him out that often he was always on hand to help with anything we needed. You get to know the restaurant staff pretty well and they always remember your name. Such a nice touch.   It's the best holiday we have ever had. "
"Went here for our honeymoon. Service was excellent from 1st day we arrive the airport until we went back to the airport. The view was magnificent everywhere, especially from our cottage where we can see the sunset. They have many side activities that we can enjoy such as watching a movie on the sands under the stars, etc. We can't get enough of scuba diving near the cottages. We also went to a scuba diving spot where we saw a few little sharks as well. Choices of food are many and delicious. Free ice creams!!  Overall, it was a good honeymoon trip for the both of us. Thanks!"
My wife and I had our best holiday ever. Six Senses exceeded our expectations in every aspect. The beach villa was luxurious with everything you needed. The service unbelievable and the food truely 5 star from all 4 restaurants. 
"We got married at the end of August. My husband booked the whole honeymoon as a surprise. The first four days we went to Dubai, but then we spent 9 nights at Six Senses Laamu.  When we arrived, from the moment we landed at the International Airport in Male, the service began. There was a nice gentleman who was waiting for us and took us through to the Domestic side and helped check us in.  We only had a short wait before gates were open, but we were still able to go into one of their lounges, which offered a free complimentary Buffet (nothing amazing - but worth it for those 20 mins waiting).  Then when we landed at the nearest island to Laamu, again another six sense representative was waiting - all very pleasant. We were taken to a speedboat - and at this point I was thinking‚Ä¶"
"We've always wanted to visit the Maldives, and after careful consideration of all the lovely resorts in the area, we selected Six Senses Laamu.  And what a great decision we made!  Loved every minute here.  Stayed 4 nights which might be a little short considering it does take some time to reach the resort.  Involves a domestic flight and then a boat ride.  The food was excellent, the service fantastic, the spa incredible.  Brought our teenage children who loved snorkeling in the warm water, playing cards and chess while looking at the view...great family memories."
"If I could imagine what my version of heaven is...this would be it. From the moment we stepped off the Maldivian plane, there were people helping us with our bags, put us on a very nice boat and talked to us about Six Senses with a few other incoming guests. When we arrived on the island, the GM welcomed us and introduced us to our personal GEM (Guest Experience Manager). Sato (spelling) was amazing the entire 10 days and was there to help us with anything we needed throughout the time. He made us an itinerary after we read through all the fun things we could do on the island and the restaurant choices.  The food was 11/10 at every place. Leaf restaurant is in a league of it's own. We ate there 3 times!  The accommodation is on point. It was the third overwater bungalow we‚Ä¶"
"Amazing stay for our honeymoon at six senses. After seeing photos of the resort, nothing is better than actually being there. As soon as we stepped onto the pier off the speedboat, we knew we were in paradise. As well as the luxury, the service from the staff took us by surprise, as we have never have experienced such hospitality and attention to detail like we did at six senses. Nothing was missed when we requested either room service or housekeeping. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. We will miss the in-room breakfasts every morning :(  A special thank you to Arif our Guest Experience Manager, you made our stay even more amazing and enjoyable. Thank you for your hospitality and punctuality. We will definitely be back soon!"
We took a domestic flight from Male (45 mins) to Kadhoo where we were greeted by a smiling young man at the arrivals who was barefoot (we would find out why soon). We were then transferred to the Six Senses Resort by a speedboat- a 15 min ride. During the journey our host explained the resorts no-shoes policy (which is of course optional) . The idea is to literally embrace the 'down to earth' concept and feel at one with nature. My husband and myself happily took off our footwear and placed them in a cool looking cloth bag provided to us. I am proud to say that we remained barefoot for the entire duration of our stay at Six Senses. It really does work! You feel free-spirited and relaxed and hey that's nature's way of giving you a free manicure.  The resort is absolutely‚Ä¶
Really nice destination. Very friendly staff that can't do enough for you. Really enjoyed the food. Snorkelling is really good with good reefs all the way round the island. Free unpowered water sports made me very happy. Not really much they could improve on and we will go back in a couple of anniversaries time   
"I have been to the Maldives twice before, didnt think it was worth venturing past the airport area, due to the headache of an extra flight.  But, Six Senses is worth it! Travel time: from Male, 35 mins domestic flight + 15 mins speed boat to the Island.  Our GEM, Yassir Was Amazing from the start, he figured out what we each liked and wanted to do, and we didnt have to think about it again, everything was scheduled and ready for our week there.  He made us feel right at home, and that nothing was too much to ask for.  We enjoyed talking to him about the Maldives ecosystem, and he is really informed about all aspects.  The room we got was the Laamu overwater pool, they are at the end of the jettys and with pool, so they are more private I guess than other villas.  The layout is‚Ä¶"
"After much research on booking a holiday in the Maldives I chose Six Senses Laamu as my choice of accommodation for our 2nd part of our honeymoon. This was the best decision I made since SSL is one of the most beautiful resorts on the Earth! It was the best holiday I have ever been on! We were looking an island on a remote atoll where we could not see even a plane or a boat, something really quiet and peaceful, and SLL was besides it is the most romantic place I have ever been! The atmosphere and vibes of this place are incredible!  When we arrived to Male, a Six Senses representative was waiting for us at the airport and helped with luggage, check-in for the domestic flight and guided us to airport lounge where could wait (wifi, snacks, drinks - very comfortable) while he‚Ä¶"
"the service is really good, the Gem is very nice to us. The food is delicious and have a lot of choice. For the room, we love it so much! we can never get enough with the room. we enjoy the pool inside the room and love the chilling area. The room we stay in can enjoy the sunrise if there is a nice weather. to conclude, there is nothing we can criticize on. will definitely come again."
"My title says it all. If you are looking for Paradise on Earth, then this is 'the' place to go. My wife and I went for our honeymoon and we loved every second of it - from arrival to departure. We were greeted with a warm and friendly welcome by our ""GEM"" - guest experience manager - who was on hand for our every need throughout our stay. Offering breath taking views, the whole place is perfect for relaxing and soaking up the Maldivian culture. Boat Trips, Dolphin spotting, Snorkelling, Outdoor Cinema (a MUST!), Pools, Fine Restaurants, wine tasting, unlimited ice-cream, this entire 'barefoot' resort has everything! Don't hesitate, just go!"
"I could repeat all of the amazing things that people have said about this resort, but that does not make for a helpful review, so let me just bullet out a few things you should know about this resort that I didn't see repeated in other reviews.  -IT IS AMAZING (okay, so others have said that, but I can't not say it!)  -About us: my husband and I are frequent travelers from NYC who love luxury but can't always afford it. This was our honeymoon, so we went big. This was also our first time in the Maldives, so I don't have a point of comparison about this country specifically (just putting it out there!).  -The journey: the lounge you wait for your domestic flight in in Male is not on par with other business/first class lounges you may have experienced. Oddly though, the way back‚Ä¶"
"From the moment you arrive at this resort you are treated like royalty. My now fiancee and I have traveled to many different places around the world, and this is by far the best we have ever seen. I cant speak highly enough about it. Everything you need has been catered for. The staff are some of the best in the business. They make you feel right at home. Everyone is so polite and friendly, always smiling and making you feel so welcomed. Nothing is too hard for them. Anything you require, you need only ask. Our personal GEM's were Hollow and Yasir, and they were incredible. Thank you again guys for our best holiday ever. The villas themselves have to be seen to be believed. Photos don't do them justice. Absolutely breath taking! They are very spacious with a huge out door shower‚Ä¶"
"It's my 2nd time to Maldives, and 1st time to Six Senses. I enjoyed my 4N stay (04 Sep - 08 Sep,2016) which was absolutely way to nice, and beyond my expectation a lot. Started from the welcoming at the airport, and speed boat to the island, Six senses brought me their eco-friendly idea which is really inspiring. They offered each visitor a cotton shoe bag and encourage you walk on your own bare feet on the island, I almost forgot I have to wear a pair of shoe when I leave the island, lol. All of the staff was very nice, they greets with sincere smile, and really takes care of your needs at anytime, any place. If you compare with Park Hyatt Maldives, Six Senses won! The whole island holds a belief of eco-friendly, so you see all the wooden structure, and they refuse plastic on‚Ä¶"
"we stayed at Six Senses for the first time for 4 nights end of August this year and i would say the overall service, maintenance of the hotel, guests mix, restaurants have all exceeded our expectation. except for the domestic flight that makes the whole journey longer, it was a resort i felt like money was well spent. "
"We stayed at Six Senses Laamu in June 2016 for a week.  It was very good and relaxed - that what you would expected from a 5* hotel.  Very good services right from the beginning till the end.  The transfer time is quite long, but worth it.  We stayed at a villa with pool at Jetty B, I would prefer Jetty C - more privacy and away from the main restaurants area.  The villa was clean and bright, but the pool is smaller than we expected, and the villas are quite close to each other.   All staff are very helpful and friendly.  The quality of the foods are very good, drinks are expensive - wish they can include the drinks with the package.  We have a BBQ on the beach, that was very nice and well worth it.  The spa treatment is the best I ever had, lovely setting and people.  Overall,‚Ä¶"
A recommended hotel. The service was very good and access for disabled. Shifa was our butler she was very good and helpful. The hotel is environment friendly and it was very big and the gym has a good view.  The breakfast was delicious and all the restaurants in the hotel was good. One of the best hotels in maldieves
The staff is wonderful. They know what you like and surprise you when they consider it. The rooms are clean. Special thanks to Mina the office manager for being super nice and welcoming. I left there knowing that this is not my last time to six senses.
"Our family (me, my husband and our three daughters - ages 10, 13 and 14) visited the Six Senses Laamu in August 2016 for one week. We flew there from New York on Aeroflot (with a 3 day layover in Moscow... Which was really fun).   The transfers in Male to Laamu (45 min flight and 50 min boat ride) was seamless with guides for every step in the process.   Our arrival was warm and welcoming by several staff and our family was assigned a ""GEM"" (guest experience manager) - Mohammed.  He greeted us warmly and gave us a full tour of the resort while pointing out activities we might be interested in.  Mohammed gave us his personal contact number and checked in its us many times during each day to help us schedule reservations and activities.  He went snorkeling with us one day to try‚Ä¶"
"This resort is amazing. We have stayed at a few different ones now in the Maldives, and while they are good, they don't compare to the Six Senses. The service of all the staff are fantastic, and nothing is ever too much trouble. You won't be disappointed. "
"What a great stay. We just returned from a wonderful vacation at 6 Senses Laamu. This was the 3rd 6 Senses Hotel we visited and it was (as the other ones)overwhelming. As soon as you step on the island you feel deeply relaxed. The standard offered is on a very high level, but at the same time all the wonderful staff members make you feel welcome and at home, since they are not trying to ""overdo"" it. I can highly recommend stay√≠ng at this place, you won't regret it. Food was awesome, service was excellent, the overwater villas phenomenal. Everything is designed to perfection and you always have the feeling of privacy, even though there are other guests around you. We will definitely come back to this magical place, we totally fell in love with."
"Spent a wonderful 10 days here in early July. Such a brilliant resort that literally ticks all the boxes in regards to beauty, food, service, staff, rooms, gym, water - everything.  Being Vegan was never an issue - the menu's cater for everyone and there is always something that worked, and the chefs are wonderfully accommodating too. The coconut dairy free ice cream was amazing - try it!  I work in travel and my wife and I have been fortunate enough to go to 3 other top 6 properties in the Maldives but we preferred SS Laamu over all of them. If you are weighing up where to go, stop, and book this place - I can assure you won't be disappointed.  See you next year!"
"We loved the Six Senses Laamu. We loved the rustic eco feel to the resort. We loved that people hung out in the bars (not the same in all hotels) and there was good vibes. The rooms are all beautiful. Jetty A and C is the best with Ocean views, otherwise you overlook other peoples watervillas. Diving was great, the people were lovely, you get a dedicated butler, the restaurants and diversity of food was great. Go full board as it's expensive in resort and then you can relax on holiday and not worry about spending. Wonderful diving nearby too."
"This was our 7th visit to the Maldives and we like to try different resorts, as they all offer something different.  I will write the good and the not so good, so people can make there own minds up;  The good;  * The staff are very friendly and always willing to help with any issues you may have. * The restaurants are excellent with a wide range of quiescence to suite everyone and the breakfasts are to die for. * The villas are of a very high standard, great beds, big pools etc. We went for a 2 bedroom beach villa for 4 of us which was huge and could have slept at least 2 families. It was amazing üòä * Spa treatments were excellent, as was the gym with fresh juice bar for afterwards. * Private dolphin cruise was amazing for the 4 of us as we had our own boat with bean bags at the‚Ä¶"
"We have just returned from two weeks in paradise at Six Senses Laamu. We were on our honeymoon and this was the perfect place to visit as it really has the wow factor and every member of staff makes you feel super special.   We visited during the 'rainy' season, this did not inhibit our enjoyment of the holiday at all as we hardly saw any rain - just the occasional short shower in the afternoon or evening. The sea was a little wavy during August (I'm not sure if it is completely still in the dry season). It was still lovely to swim in and the clarity was excellent for snorkelling as well.  We had an ocean view villa on jetty B  which was just beautiful. The view was amazing. I would recommend jetties A and B over Jetty C. The beach villas also looked very nice and private.  Our‚Ä¶"
"We've had a great week here, but we had been in the Maldives before (3 yrs ago, at Gili Lankanfushi) and that trip was 100% perfect, so the bar + our expectations were high. And unfortunately Six Senses does not meet our expectations of a trip to the Maldives.   The snorkeling around the island is quite poor. (again; compared to gili lankanfushi, where there were a zillion different fish right in front of our villa, including mantas, reef sharks, turtles, blow fish, lion fish and so on). We tried different spots, also in front of one of the restaurants, where there is the best snorkeling they said. But is was just average, nothing special, and the reef was all dead. So we decided to go on a snorkeling trip. They took us to 2 reefs. But also: dead reef and not much wildlife under‚Ä¶"
Just an amazing place!  The first thing that struck us was the request for our shoes as we boarded the high speed boat to the island.  No one wears shoes.  I gladly kicked mine off signalling the start of relaxation.  The second thing that struck me was the lack of electronic devices at dinner (or breakfast).  People were talking and laughing and connecting.  The energy was stunning.  Our villa (highly recommend #18 at the end of the jetty A) overlooked the turquoise blue waters and coral reef that was directly in front of us.  The sunrise glowed through our windows in the morning and the sunset provided great pictures overall cocktails from our villa balcony or the bar.  The staff at the spa were highly professional and I took the opportunity to have private yoga instruction‚Ä¶
"Having read so many wonderful reviews about this resort, I knew it would be fabulous - the words however do not do it justice.   From the moment you arrive, the Six Senses team take care of everything and ensure you are all looked after.   Our personal Guest Experience Manager organised our activities, booked our special dinner events and ensured we were taken care of.   Our overwater bungalow with all of life's luxuries including a private pool was superb and the personalised license plates for our bikes were a great personal touch.   Apart from the bluest of waters and the warmest of days, there were two stand outs for me. One was the Champagne dinner where the head sommelier Karim hosted a beautiful evening for us - amazing! The other was the music at the Chill Bar every‚Ä¶"
"This is a place where everyone should go once in their lifetime. When you arrive with the speedboat or seaplane many crew members a ready to greet you at the pier, and you will be taken through small paths in your personal buggy to your house. I stayed in a pool water villa on jetty B. A beautiful woodhouse with infinity pool and amazing sundeck to relax and have a drink. Everything about this resort is so peaceful. However not boring at all - if you want action there are plenty of things to do. Diving and snorkeling is great. Right in front of the house grow seagrass, and seaturtles hang about all day. Sometimes a stingray pass by or maybe a small shark (nothing to worry about). The restaurants has an asian theme going on in the evening. The food is japanese (had the best‚Ä¶"
"Amazing resort, villas are incomparable, service is excellent, couldn't have asked for anything better. The personalised service and our own special  great experience maker, ""hollow"" was so happy, friendly, nothing was too much trouble, he anticipated what we needed before we did. The water is more aquamarine than I have ever seen in my life, better than the brochure."
"I made the best decision when I chose this place for our first ever trip to Maldives. Can't wait to go back already, everything was just beyond PERFECT. :) Thank you Mafaz, Mina, Megan, Nini, Jill and etc for making our stay wonderful. xx"
"We were so excited to book our honeymoon trip to the Maldives! We didn't even know where to start looking because every place seemed to have great reviews. We did some intense research and in the end Six Senses seemed to be the best in every sense, from location to price to accommodations.   Upon arrival we were met at the airport by a Six Senses employee and he quickly took our luggage and put us in a lounge area with free wifi and a mini buffet. We had to wait about 2 hours for the next domestic flight, which was probably the only inconvenience  of this trip. When you arrive to the Maldives, you want to hurry and use every minute you have rather than waste it stuck in an airport. We flew to another island and then escorted onto a speedboat where we were welcomed with the‚Ä¶"
"My husband & i just came back from 7 nights stay at Six Senses Laamu... &  Let me start off by saying that it was truly an incredible flawless experience ..  For those lucky enough to visit, the Maldives is one of the most spectacular destinations in the world and S.S. hotel made it an unforgettable trip for us.  The staff is out-of-this-world.. - Our Gem YASIR was extremely helpful, professional  and goes out of his way to make sure that we are enjoying our experience . -the waiters and bartenders are really kind and funny - Mr. Mina the front desk manager is so nice,friendly and helpful.  the room: the over-water villa is  the most quiet, relaxing and laid-back place I've ever been to.  and the ""view from the BED"" is like a postcard with all the shades of blue.. the food: we‚Ä¶"
"if you search a Relaxing place to be- THIS IS JUST PERFECT!  the stuff was so friendly, the rooms were georgeos, the view was breathtaking. Same with the beach and just the whole Location. At the beach you are completely alone. I felt like i'm dreaming. We also did a lot of attractions like snorkeling, diving, waterski, wakeboard and other stuff.  Of course it's also quite expensive but it's worse it!"
"On behalf of my family thank you for an extraordinary experience at SSR. My husband and I have been traveling the globe every year, for the last 20 years, and we haven‚Äôt had an experience like we just had at Six Senses Resort.  This was our 4th trip to the Maldives and we would happily return to Six Senses, it ticked every box. The transfers were perfect to and from the resort and from the time we arrived bare foot we were in heaven. The snorkelling from our ocean villa was exactly what we were after.  The kids were so enthusiastic about the snorkelling because it was so easy to swim from Chill bar and witness truly another world!  The scuba diving excursions were fantastic. The service and food were exceptional. The kids club and swimming pool were great. The resort is great‚Ä¶"
Quiet and comfortable for family trip looking for resting and re-energizing. Great services and good hardware. Basic bicycle skill is required and bare foot all time on the island is a pleasant experience. Would love to go back again.
"Six senses managed to create an indescribable holiday for us. The villa (over water) was perfectly equipped, and the lagoon right outside the doorstep, is just great for a refreshing cool down swim.  The food is at the highest level, lots of healthy, organic choices.  The staff has a good given talent for service. They excel in a personal relaxed luxury atmosphere. Also I used the dive center... Had a great experience here too. They finished my daughters referral OWD. And I went diving with mantas.  All in all, probably one of my best travel experiences... Can only be recommended. "
"Friendly and Educated staff - Amazing food, wine and drinks - Paradise on earth - Good for families with many activities - One of the worlds top resorts - Good for snorkeling and diving - Perfect villas - Everything is perfect at this place - Super Breakfast"
"We stayed at Six Senses Laamu this July and had a lovely experience. We were immediately amazed by the architecture of the resort. Everything is built out of natural materials, mostly wood, and it's one of the few islands where restaurants and central hubs are built directly over the water, made even more special by the glass floors. We stayed in the Laamu Water Villa which featured glass floors of it's own as well - one beneath the glass bathtub, another where your feet go when having a moment in the loo, and a third beneath the dining booth located on your private deck, next to the lounge chairs and over water hammock.  Dining is very nice here and there are several different vibe options depending on what you feel like - 'Longitude' is an international restaurant with‚Ä¶"
"The best resort you can imagine to spend the more relaxing and paradisiacal holidays You have a lot of acitvities to do, water sports, the best Yoga and pilates retrieve. If you like natual food, then you will enjoy the restaurants an the growth they have with many different plants local and International ones, sprouted grains.. TOP place to visit! "
"Everything was perfect: the location, the facilities, the food, the amazing staff...everything was so clean, so focused on details and Customers wellness!! The breakfast buffet, with so many choices, the restaurants for lunch and dinner....the spa, simply perfect!! The over water villa was spectacular, and the surrounding was great!! The swimming pool was clean, spacious and very quiet. One of the best hotels I have ever been, not to talk about the staff, they were simply great.   If you want a perfect stay surrounded by crystal waters, that's the place!!"
"I have travelled a lot and this is THE MOST amazing week I have EVER had.  I was so overcome with emotion on arrival that I cried!  Everything about Six Senses Laamu is perfect, I do not have a single negative comment to make.  The staff made me feel like royalty, my over water villa was breathtaking, the food sensational and the whole relaxed lifestyle was just amazing.  My day started with a delicious breakfast in the overwater restaurant with just too many options to choose from.  Next was a laze on the day bed in my villa, then a jump in the ocean.  Lunch by the pool, then a surf lesson, snorkelling, pilates or most days I just relaxed by the pool or in my villa.  Apparently it was 'rainy season' but I had a week of complete sunshine - bliss!  My favourite part of the day‚Ä¶"

"Where do I start? Our vacation was simply AMAZING. My husband and I spent a week there and we didn't want to leave. This place is gorgeous. The open setting is stunning, you see the ocean everywhere you go and this is how I like my vacations.   As soon as we landed on the island, we were picked up by the hotel staff who took care of our luggage and walked us to our boat where we were given refreshments. After a beautiful 30 min boat ride, we arrived at the hotel. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the GM and the staff and introduced to our GEM Ravah (this guy is absolutely fantastic!). We went for a quick tour of the resort before going to our room.   From then on, it was an amazing 7 days. Ravah is an excellent GEM, he is extremely nice and helped us so much through out our stay.‚Ä¶"

"We picked Six Senses Laamu to celebrate our first wedding anniversary based on a recommendation from Turquoise Holidays, who booked our honeymoon.   From the moment we arrived, we were in paradise. They have a ""no shoes"" policy from when you are picked up by water taxi from the airport. The idea that you are relaxed, ‚Äúdown to earth‚Äù and like you are at home. You are provided with your own GEM (guest experience manager) who looks after your every need until it‚Äôs time to go home. We called ours the genie as whenever we needed something, he literally seemed to appear and sort it  They have their very own chocolate room, ice cream parlour, wine cellar, open air cinema (complete with popcorn), herb garden complete with chilli experience evening, surf shop, dive school, private‚Ä¶"
"I was traveling with my mother, aunt, and sisters for a 5-day vacation to relax and have fun. Everything about this trip and stay at six senses Laamu made it worthwhile.  A staff member from the resort is greeted us when we arrived at the Male airport and helped us through all the steps until we boarded the internal flight to Kadhdhoo airport. There was another representative waiting at the Kadhdhoo airport when we arrived to transport us to the resort by boat. The boat ride was the first step of our relaxation and bliss. Refreshing coconut water, cold towels, and a bag to keep our shoes in (loved the feeling of the wind on my feet). The vacation begins.  When we arrived, we were greeted by the general manager and the staff. A GEM (guest experience maker) was assigned to us to‚Ä¶"
"What can I saw ... Perfect place to get away and relax ... What else can I say .... A big thank you to all the staff, especially Shefu (our GeM)  If you get the opportunity to go here, make sure you go an do a Back  of House tour, it is amazing to see what a eco friendly place work ... ( the recycling guy is the amazing)"
everything about this place was impeccable. Yasir (our butler / GEM) - took care of us - we traveled here with a 6 year old - and we stayed at the villa with pool on the ocean side (not lagoon side) - all in all amazing trip.  The resort design just blends with nature - pure bliss.
"Stayed a week in a water villa. Website and photos just don't do this resort justice. From the moment we arrived in Male airport, the speedboat transfer, our arrival on the beautiful island, the accommodation and restaurants and the seaplane transfer back to Male, we were looked after and treated so well. A special thanks to our GEM Shifu for making our stay extra special and to Reehan in Chill, Ahmed and Kathoo in Sip Sip. The wildlife and scenery are amazing. Such a special place."
"When we decided to go to the Maldives with our 5-month-old baby, we just didn't know how amazingly perfect choice Six Senses Laamu would be. We have already been there and always enjoyed it enormously but didn't realise that it was one of the most baby-friendly resorts we have ever been to. Huge comfortable daybeds everywhere, both on your terrace and in the restaurants, a truly outstanding team of hosts providing world class service with a personal touch, special care and attention to youngsters and toddlers - and a unique out-of-the-box approach which even makes it possible to have a couple massage under the stars on the beach after the spa's opening hours while a professional babysitter takes care of your sleeping baby in your villa two hundred meters from the beach. A dream,‚Ä¶"
"excellent, relaxing and I enjoyed the activities at the spa f.o.c such as meditation and yoga. I loved the opportunity to have a tarot card reader and a natural healer. The Vietnamise restaurant with a JG was also a must."
"We just had the best family holiday ever with our boys aged 9 and 12! With free unlimited 42 flavours of homemade ice cream, beach film nights with kids buffets, excellent kids club, bike riding, fantastic snorkelling and water sports, it's the best holiday for children of all ages! We first went to six senses laamu when it opened 3 years ago but it's even better now! It's more kid friendly than before and there are more kids there as a result, not just honeymooners! The new pool area with swim up bar and pizza oven is a great place to hang, especially for the children. The staff were amazing, especially Dave, who runs the Water Sports. He's fantastic with kids and his experience, patience and kindness teaching our little boy to surf really made the holiday extra special for us!‚Ä¶"
This is a destination for people that appreciate excellent presentation and care from a resort but do want to have the opportunity to enjoy this leisurely.  That is what six senses laamu is all about. (in my opinion)
"Six Senses Lamau is a very special place. The staff are so friendly and helpful, especially our GEM Shifa.  They just want to make your holiday perfect.  What is lovely about the place is that it is a very relaxed, chilled out place.  They give you a bag to put your shoes in whilst on the speedboat to the island and suggest you leave them there for the duration of your holiday. The accommodation is beautiful. The water villas are so well equipped and very spacious.  It was lovely having the turtles, fish and mantra rays swim by the villa.  I took an excursion with their marine biologist to coral reefs further off the island and I would recommend guests doing this. Thr colours of the fish and the reefs were amazing.  We celebrated a very special occasion whilst there and it was‚Ä¶"

"I enjoyed so much on the house reef snorkelling. We saw turtle and school of surgeon fishes (Dory).  While doing diving with Ocean Dimensions, I saw manta Michele. Also, giant turtle as big as a table coral. I can't ask for anymore for 2 tanks boat dives.  Food is so good. Love the settings in the room and GEM Sifu assistant. I had a great 4 days 3 nights stay.

"The stay was exactly what you would expect from six senses five star all the way. Perfect service from every single member of staff, with out being in any way intrusive. The facilities were excellent and just as new as the last time we visited a lot of time is spent  constantly updating the facilities. The food is amazing especially from the leaf restaurant. The whole atmosphere is calm relaxing and feels luxurious . Our Gem, Yasir was particularly good , so ask for him if you go!"
"Our stay at Six Senses Laamu has been wonderful, I knew that it will be special but it exceeded our expectations.   From the arrival in Male airport everything was taken care of and planned perfectly.   As all the previous reviewers say, the villas are beautifully finished, well equipped and kept in spotless condition so I do not need to add anymore details. Personalised bikes are very nice touch and I did not believe that there would be a place on earth where shoes are not needed - well it is here and by the end of the week I realised that I did not have to pack any sandals.   All the staff were amazing but I just wanted to mention few people who made the stay that bit special. Auzam - our Gem, who really is a gem Javaa - restaurant senior hostess, who looked after us so well.‚Ä¶"
"We had the best experience at Six Senses Laamu. We stayed in the lagoon overwater villas for a total of 4 nights with half board. The villa had an amazing view and each morning we could see the beautiful sunrise. The resort also had great facilities, a personal bike to ride around the resort and good restaurants with our favourite one being the Leaf restaurant. Overall, the whole trip and resort was more than what we had expected.   All the staff were friendly and we were lucky to have Shifa as our GEM who looked after us during our whole stay.  We would highly recommend this resort especially for honeymoon!   "

"Paradise is what i call for Six Senses Laamu. I am a wedding planner and there was a couple who had their wedding here. Great environment with blue sea and blue sky, i love the people here they are so humble and nice, and also with amazing food..."
"Truly a unique and wonderful experience. Our visit far exceeded our already high expectations. Other than the cost, the only downside was that we could not stay longer and we were mislead about there being a range of surf breaks nearby. There is one good wave for advanced surfers, but nothing notable for intermediates. Fortunately the rest of the experience was among the best to be had anywhere. We had a fantastic time with the dive center - Ocean Dimensions - and in particular with our dive guide Margerita and the owner, Petra. Both took particularly good care of us - a family of two adults and two teenagers."
"We stayed in Laamu for 4 days to celebrate my husband birthday. Everything was absolutely fantastic from the minute we arrived - beautiful area and villas (we had ocean villa), amazing attention to detail and great services. Thank you so much for everything ... And sorry it took me so long to write the review!!"
"We loved our first time to Laamu and felt it was the only place we could go back to if we ever went to the Maldives again. So we did go back and it was just as wonderful. We tried the spa this time, which is basically an open air coocoon beach side - bliss. We also had a private session with Kunchuk in the gym, which we loved. Working out in the gym with incredible views over Indian Ocean...what can you say? We were there just before the Christmas holiday so it was quite busy, but this was only noticed at breakfast time. The food, the service, the chilled atmosphere. I'm not really sure how you could beat this place. Love it."
"We went to Six Senses Laamu for our honeymooon, and from the moment we stepped barefoot (one of the island's optional policy's) onto the island we knew we would not want to leave. The resort and staff were amazing - we can not fault a thing! The staff were always extremely friendly and helpful - nothing was too much trouble. They always remembered your name and your personal likes. Our lagoon water villa was absolutely stunning (very clean, comfortable and with bathroom facilities and views to die for) and the food & drink on the island was fantastic - we tried all the restaurants as well as the Surf n Turf BBQ on the beach and the Champagne tasting dinner at the Wine Cellar.

The staff are incredible but a special call out to:  - The General Manager, Marteyne. Amazing attention to guest needs and extremely hands-on personal management of the resort.   - Our Dive Master, Margherita, who was amazing, friendly, knowledgable, and passionate about the oceans - and a great dive companion!

"My wife and I are rabid travelers with often jaded expectations.  Having regularly indulged ourselves in the past, we have often been impressed, but never before had I felt compelled enough to write a review.

World-Class service with absolute attention to detail; Mind-blowing, well-planned accommodations; Unique and diverse activities; Quite easily the best spa services my wife and I have ever experienced; and MORE!

"We spent eight phenomenal days at Six Senses Laamu in April, 2016.  It was our honeymoon and I'm quite sure a trip neither of us will ever forget.  I meant to type this review earlier but even now 6 weeks later, its all awesome memories and easy to recount the highlights.  Most of the resorts in the Maldives that we looked at were basically one resort on an island. This island, Laamu, is truly an oasis: filled with fantastic food, fun things to do, a phenomenal villa but most importantly, great people who genuinely seem interested in making you feel important and special.  Physical location (Maldives = Amazingly beautiful, picturesque & breath taking... just like they say) definitely is a plus, but honestly in the end the great staff here are what make this place so wonderful. ‚Ä¶"
"By far the most beautiful place we have ever been, I'm not sure that any review can do this resort justice! The resort itself is absolutely stunning everywhere you look, we were totally overwhelmed with it's beauty and never wanted to put our camera away.  The staff are equally as beautiful! Having not been to the Maldives before myself I wasn't quite sure what to expect however I can honestly say I have not come across such genuinely beautiful people, whoever does the recruitment at this resort should be super proud!! All of the staff are so beautifully softly spoken, polite, helpful and intelligent.  Our GEM, Mohamed, was amazing.  We joked that he seemed to know what we were thinking, making dinner and activity reservations for us at the perfect times and places moments after‚Ä¶"
From the time we step on the speedboat you experience the excellent service and warm welcome.  The staff is immaculate from the waiters and top staff to the ladies raking the sand at the bicycle shed's.  There is absolutely nothing I can put my finger on that was wrong.  The thought on every detail in rooms and in restaurants with all meals was excellent....thank you
"this trip was one more than i expected, i enjoyed every part of it. It was such an amazing experience, food is good, place is enviroment friendly and the beach is just breath taking. defiantly we will revisit. Thank you six senses for being a part of our great journey. "
"Six Senses does the luxury experience well, but not over the top. We stayed in an over water villa with pool, at the end of the first jetty. The villas are perfectly understated, and don't compete with the amazing view. The staff is great - very friendly and eager to help, but without being intrusive. Spa treatments were delightful, I loved the Ayurvedic treatments. Food wasn't especially impressive, I think if we had stayed beyond the 7 nights it would have grown old. If you are a diver, the manta ray dive and outer reef dives are incredible- I highly recommend."
We had an amazing time at Six Senses Laamu. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly . Made our honeymoon  very memorable .Our room was super clean and very pleasant to say in .I highly recommend this place. Thank you so much 
"Upon arrival we were greeted by the staff and director to welcome us. Our GEM (Guest Experience Manager) Sato talked to us about the resort and showed us around the island (3 minutes in a golf buggy) He showed us where the spa and restaurants where, then eventually to our bungalow.  **My fianc√© and I arranged to get married at the resort. So everything was planned by Sato from timing to photographer to our first meal as a married couple. We we soo well looked after and the bungalow was stunning, the view and the reef just about 100 meters from our bunglow was nothing like we had ever seen. My husband and I went snorkling about 3 times a day and there were fish everywhere, turtles, and even manta rays!   We hadn't chosen where on the island we wanted the ceremony but they told us‚Ä¶"
"After visiting Six Senses Laamu recently I don't think anything else will ever impress me. The resort, setting, rooms and staff were absolutely amazing and being in the travel industry, I can now without doubt or hesitation recommend this resort to any client wanting a magical island experience."
"Be warned...if you visit Six Senses Laamu any other island destination will fall short. It is perfection in every way. Spoil yourself, it's a must. The water is the most magnificent blue and the sand is soft and white. Definitely have an oriental massage and be sure to leave your shoes at home. Your personalised bike was a refreshing way to get around and was fun as well. Plan your ice-creams stops...42 flavours are all worth trying! The food was fresh and delicious with a wide variety of restaurants to choose from. The staff were exceptional, they always had a friendly smile and couldn't do enough. "
"This was our first stay at a Six Senses resort and it was absolutely amazing! We were referred here by AMEX travel and they were correct as usual. Our room (Villa #68) had an amazing view of the open ocean and other villas in the distance. I highly recommend getting a Ocean Villa with a pool as it was hot during the day and the pool is a nice way to cool off! The ocean was beautiful and the water temp was perfect. The staff was polite and very accommodating to anything you may need. The food was delicious, but the best meal is breakfast! We ate at our villa on the deck every morning and it was amazing! It rained 1 of the 7 days we were here, which was perfect considering we came in the rainy season. The bartenders at The Chill Bar are cool and make some pretty good drinks! Sip‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses Laamu was a complete piece of Paradise. From the moment you arrived, greeted by smiley members of the Six senses team you felt completely relaxed and excited to see what was in store. Arriving at our villa, I was unsure what to expect (I was not aware of the accommodation type), however it didn't disappoint.  We had been treated to a Villa with a infinity pool over looking the most beautiful clear waters with the occasional sting ray popping past to say welcome. An Outdoor shower, glassbath tub, a seriously big comfy bed all made for amazing comfy and dream like situation. The personal touch of your initials on the bikes parked out side villa really gave the sense of being welcomed 'home'!  It didn't stop there, as well as the villa being breathtaking, the food was‚Ä¶"
"Being value conscious, I had always thought Maldives was overpriced and over-hyped. Six Senses proved me wrong! My wife will can probably write up a more descriptive review but in short; - service was great not just from our dedicated service rep (aka GEM) but all staff there - Relaxing spa and skillful masseuse. (We get massage regularly and we are not easy to please) - Great decor and natural theme - we feel relaxed and immersed in nature - Plenty of (free) activities to choose from - We spent most of our time swimming, snokeling among the beautiful house reef and windsurfing  - No-plastic and environmental conscious theme really drive home Highly recommended!!"
"We honeymooned here in April 2016 and we couldn't have had a more wonderful experience.  We wanted somewhere absolutely luxurious and after reading the excellent reviews here I had pretty high expectations.  I can honestly say that all expectations were exceeded.  We were treated and taken care of the entire time.  Our GEM, Irene, was just wonderful.  She was very attentive without being intrusive.   Also the sustainability efforts of the resort are obvious and should be commended. This place truly is heaven on earth and we can't wait to return."
"We visited Laamu in 2012 and it was awesome. We always prefer Beach villas, rather than over water villas, because we love the sand under our feet and also lying in the sand which we enjoyed with the high level of privacy very much. The food is outrageous and very rich in variety! Staff is very friendly, the complete island seems to be your own as you do not encounter many people during the day. We loved the stay and it can be 110% recommended! the beds are of hight level comfort, the shower is stunning, no more words for this place called paradise!"
"I cannot speak more highly of our stay at Laamu, it was simply wonderful from start to finish.  I work in the Luxury Travel sector and I see a lot of hotels but Laamu is hands down the best place I have ever stayed, the service, the food the drinks the snorkelling, the spa, the ethos and the staff are all brilliant and I cannot recommend it enough."
"How could I possibly turn down the opportunity to spend a week in paradise with my dearest Mum and Sister? Especially as it would allow me a blissful break from being a working mum of 2 little ones, whom I love very much but who are a constant strain to all my senses!!!  Everything was arranged - childcare, food shop, GP's telephone number programmed in to my husbands' speed-dial...I was free to go!  Granted, I would have been pretty happy to go anywhere for some peace and quiet but my sister, who had visited SS Laamu before, ensured me this had to be the place for us to go. ""Utter bliss"" ""Heaven on Earth"" ""Incredible hospitality"" ""Total relaxation"" - how right she was. Quite simply, if you are looking for somewhere from which to escape your reality and which will offer you‚Ä¶"
"My husband and I planned a fantastic honeymoon in India full of culture and diversity, but we really wanted a way to finish it off with a week of relaxation and there was no doubt in our minds, it had to be the Maldives! We were so pleased with our choice!  We took a long time researching atolls and resorts. We wanted to go south because the coral bleaching is less but not be in an area where there are too many currents as hubby is not the strongest swimmer. With that in mind, it also proved tricky because I wanted good scuba diving as I'm a water baby and he wanted good food and drink as he's more of a land lover. This was quite a challenge because some of the more reasonably priced resorts have OK food and great diving/reef or great food and OK diving/reef. Well, six senses‚Ä¶"
"Wow. Beautiful island resort. The rooms are large and spacious. Well thought out and comfortable. Know that All the overwater villas are the same. You pay more for only 2 things: 1. If you want a private plunge pool or 2: the view. The sunset facing villas are great because after 4pm you will still have sun where as the others have no sun after 4pm. The jettys are long (be prepared to use the bikes...they are long long walks. Unless you get one closer to shore. Jetty A is closest to the main areas. Jetty B and C are great for privacy. The food is very good at this resort and fresh. The snorkelling is amazing. You will likely see a turtle, shark and sting ray while here. Try to book the Dolphins as well. "
"We held a company event at the Six Senses Laamu with about 25 people for 4 days.  The resort was truly amazing, and definitely what I consider paradise.  Zhilah was incredibly professional and very easy to work with leading up to our event and also while we were there.  She thought of every detail and made all of our ideas come to life, including a beautiful dinner on the beach, a yacht charter to a private island for a picnic and much more.  The rooms are all so beautiful and every room has a great view.  I was in a room on the beach and it was so nice to walk right out of my front door onto the beach.  The overwater rooms are beautiful too, which is where the rest of group stayed and they all raved about these amazing rooms and views.  Our GEM, Yasir, was so helpful and kind. ‚Ä¶"
"Life gives one lots of different kinds of experiences, and yet even amongst the good ones there are those few which stand out as truly wonderful, singularly spectacular, authentically awesome.  Such was the case for us on our recent visit to Six Senses, Laamu.  In fact, it was so spectacular that we are having a challenging time trying to decide how to begin this review.  While trying to not sound too effusive, everything about our experience at Six Senses, Laamu, did seem simply perfect.  Looking over the TripAdvisor reviews of this place should convince you that the review your presently reading need not be very long.  After all, what more could be said than has already been said ‚Äî and by so many others?  Well, we will not tell you about the amazing beauty of our over-water‚Ä¶"
"We spent the last week of our honeymoon on Six Senses Laamu. The most unbelievable resort, our GEM couldn't have been kinder or more helpful and our lagoon water villa was beautifully appointed and comfortable. The outdoor bathroom has to be seen to be believed. The food was excellent, breakfasts and notably the Asian buffet were highlights of the trip. We were very happy honeymooners. Thank you so much for looking after us so well."
"Perfect place to unwind, rest and relax.  From the water villas to the kids club every inch of detail was thought of.  The best bit was that we were worried our children may get bored but they couldn't get enough of kids club, every morning they were begging us to go! And the girls there were so lovely and caring and made you feel so comfortable leaving your precious little ones with them.  They would even take them in the evening so you could sit and eat dinner in peace. I would recommend this place over and over again... And are hoping to visit another six senses very soon somewhere else."
"After 4 times in the Maldives and 3 times to the great Moofushi resort it was time for a change: the Six Senses, not the closest of islands (you need to prepare for a long trip if you come from the EU) but it was more than worth while. Must say the Moofushi team at airport had a better arrival package (quicker and own airport lounge) however from the moment we arrived at the local airport Laamu and  welcomed to take place in the speedboat the Six Senses hospitality hit high. The complete welcome team including the GM (it was not the last time we saw the manager, he was allover the place and very much involved) and our own personal guide Irene (who was absolutely  amazing), the breakfast team and not to forget the dive center team were all extremely caring and delivering a top‚Ä¶"
"Had just spend a couple of days in the paradise called Six Senses Laamu. The Resort gives you a feeling of being welcomed from the first minute you arrive at their speed boat. The ""no shoes"" policy makes you really feel being stranded on an island. We loved our Water villa with pool, the glass bathtub and the glass floor in the powder room. The design of the villa is very cozy and very well maintained. The bikes with your initials is one of the best ideas of the resort. The breakfast and dinner in the main restaurant was outstanding same like the service team. Our GEM was a gem. The spa has a lovely layout with couple rooms, very clean with perfect treatments done by professional therapists. Being at Six Senses Laamu gives you maximum relaxation and one of the best hospitality‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses Laamu has it all, the perfect location, the amazing food and activities and the most wonderful staff.  They make sure that from the moment you land everything is perfect and smooth. Everybody can have a great time thanks to the organisation that is faultless ! In only one week we managed to do so many things that were organised to perfection by our GEM Irene. We had a lot of family time and also some romantic dinners. We could snorkel, scuba dive, paddle board and enjoy the great food. The boys had an amazing time as well thank you to the great kids club with Cori, the boat trips with Zalif, the bubble making course with the lovely Italian girl at the diving centre , the cinema under the stars at dinner time. Time flew very quickly and we can t wait to go back! "
"An amazing time.  Exceeded expectations!!  Staff were very well trained and responsive.  Facilities were immaculate.  Food and wine selection was also very good, the staff sommelier was very thoughtful and put on a few great wine dinners.  A treat!"
Spent a week here on honeymoon. Wow wow wow. Lagoon water villa was beautiful. Breakfast had an amazing spread and frequent dolphin/Ray sightings with prosecco in hand works nicely. Restaurants for dinner were all lovely - can thoroughly recommend them all.  Drinks aren't cheap so take advantage of happy hour - in particular at the chill out bar with sunset.  Ice cream bar was a great touch although not sure the cycle there and back burnt enough calories.  We were very very sad to leave.
"The resort is well taken care of, from the front of the house to the back.  Villa 68 was a flawless home for our 7 day stay.  Arif, our GEM, was on top of everything throughout our stay.  He was attentive, but not intrusive.  He made sure we had everything we needed, especially when we were under the weather, he sent over supplies that perked us right back up.  The food was very good, though I wouldn't necessarily rave about the Asian or seafood buffets.  However; you can't go wrong with the free ice cream!  And Leaf restaurant was always fantastic. I would recommend everyone take the back of the house tour to really see the efforts Six Senses takes to be as sustainable as possible, given the environmental circumstances of the country.  Additionally, would also recommend the‚Ä¶"
The most diligent service team and the most beautiful location.  Villa I recommend the pool beach villa. Much more private. Still have direct access to the sea but you have more space and nicer surroundings than the sea villas built on water  Food It is hard to find things to improve but if I had to say anything it would be food. A lot to offer but all restaurants and in villa dining could be a bit better. My criteria is quite demanding but the truth is that for what you pay you have to demand more.  Service The best ever. The GEM's are diligent to solve any minor problems. We always felt accompanied.
"I have just spent 5 luxury days at what can only be described as Heaven ... from the most spectacular views, to the most amazing staff compliment, I can only rave about my stay.  Frans, the GM at the resort, needs to be complimented on the facilities which area immaculately kept, and the wonderful friendly staff who could not do enough for us.  The weather, was great, although we had moments of rain, it ultimately cleared and we thoroughly enjoyed the beaches, water activities and of course the pool / bar area.  The only draw back (and not any fault of the resort), is that our South African Rand is currently so weak against the dollar, it makes for an expensive excursion - but hopefully this wont be a problem for too long :)   Thank you QR airways and Six Senses for an amazing‚Ä¶"
"We stayed in Six Sense resort and it was beautiful. The service, accommodations and personnel were excellent! My husband was in love with the food choices, especially at breakfast. We stayed in the first jetty in bungalow 28. It was gorgeous. Our Gem, IRENE was exceptional. She was very attentive & made our stay even more wonderful. I went diving with Oceans dimension and was blessed with the absolute best instructor, Margarita. I'm older and I don't dive every year. She took excellent care of me underwater. Even held my hand when I was a little anxious. I felt very relaxed with her. She made my under water exposure a lot more fun. Would I stay there again absolutely."
"We had a great time here, loved the island, happy staff, food and weather. Its one of those places that take care of the little details. The food variety is great and severed very nice. We loved how they build all the wooden houses and trying to recycle as much materials as they can. It feels like the place naturally belongs on the island."
"We stayed for a week in April 2016 having previously stayed at the LUX resort further north. We stayed at a six senses in Oman which we loved so we were keen to stay with the same brand in the Maldives.  We plumped for a water villa this time as we did a beach villa at the LUX. The water villa was superb, great facilities, beautiful view, excellent staff and service. Leaf restaurant was really good, the breakfast was also really good too."
"We arrived at this resort by boat at 2:00 AM in the middle of a fierce storm.   At the wharf waiting for us was the general manager  together with our GEM (their word for the staff member assigned to look after us) - very impressive.  The weather improved and we had a wonderful stay. The coral is being affected by global warming - the problem is bleaching.  The staff were brilliant, always smiling and polite.  The amenities could not be faulted, with hayaks, windsurfers, a catamaran and various activities such as diving, snorkelling and fishing charters.  A bicycle is provided for each guest's personal use."
"We were so lucky to celebrate my 50th with the children. 2 overwater bungalows, one with pool. The entire resort was like a dream. Everything was perfect. The view was phenomenal everyday, the service, the food, the environment. It was absolutely mind blowing."
"We are a family of 5 , my wife , myself and 3 children 13,15 and 16 , and decided on Six Senses as a once in a lifetime trip for my wife's 50th. That has changed . We will be back . This place cannot be described using words, nothing could verbally do it justice.  From the setting with everywhere you look a postcard , the colours of the water , which changes depending on the time of day . To the rooms , we had two overwater villas on jetty B , 41 and 47 I think . One with a pool which faced west , and one facing east which meant we could find shade any time of day , but could watch the sunsets from 41. All the rooms are similar inside , beautiful inside with an amazing outdoor shower area and rooftop day bed . I have read reviews about which jetty is best and all 3 have‚Ä¶"
"This is the most spectacular place I have been to in my whole life. From the second you jump onto the speed boat to get to the six senses you know, this is going to be special. Absolutely  everything was impeccable, no need to go through every detail because I will have to write a novel, so Imagine every thing has a gold lining here & I could end it at that but I have to mention a few things to give you an example. Our Gem (Guest entertainment Manager) Shifu was really a gem so to speak, ask & you shall receive.. Food, top class & nothing more you could want for, oh except Vegemite lol. Service, best I've encountered. Over water bungalow, amazing. Day spa, Top class. Beach, heaven on earth.. Thank you each & every one of you for the best holiday of my life!!"
"This is our 2nd visit to this wonderful place. We went for 10 days over Easter to Laamu. Last year was our first visit, and we were so taken, and loved the place so much that we had to bring my wife's parents this time, so they too could experience this. Our only complaint last year was that the food wasn't really up to the standard of the resort it self. But this year we are happy to say that that was not the case anymore. The food was excellent! But above everything else is the staff! They are the most friendly and helpful one could ever ask for. Our GEM (Guest Experience Maker, your own ""concierge"") was fantastic, and so was everyone else on the resort. I could go on and on about everything that was great about our visit, but I'm gonna cheat and cut it short, and just say‚Ä¶"
"This was our 5th trip to the Maldives, every one to a different island, each experience being memorable and leaving us wanting to go back for more. What stood out on this trip was the incredible service provided by everyone we came into contact with. Having read about the GEM (Guest Experience Maker) I was a little bit cynical about what I thought would be a marketing gimmick. How wrong I was, our GEM, Auzam, was like the perfect personal assistance that has worked for you for 10 years, someone that knows what you want before you know yourself. The quality and choice of food was also excellent, the best we have had in the Maldives, the Leaf restaurant it is very close to Michelin star quality.  A few general observations; 1. This is a slightly larger island than many and the‚Ä¶"
"We love Six Senses. We love it so much that this was our third visit to one of their gorgeous hotels in a year. We were blown away by Con Dao, and we thought Zighy Bay was fabulous. But would Laamu match up? There are a lot of very high end options in the Maldives so it was a tricky decision but I have to say we weren't disappointed. Laamu certainly matched our expectations and in some respects exceeded them. Which is just as well as it's A Long Way. Once you arrive in Male (via Dubai for us) we then had to hang around for a couple of hours before taking a Maldivian flight to an island in the Laamu atoll and from there a 20 minute speedboat ride. We were pretty exhausted when we arrived but seeing how beautiful the island is gave us a second wind.  And it is really lovely - the‚Ä¶"
"If you want to stop and take time to just breathe, walk barefoot ,swim with the dolphins and colourful beautiful fish, be very close to the nature and wake up surrounded by most perfect turquoise ocean, eat biological delicious food prepared with love,  propose your love one at the most astonishing sunset ,or  spend honeymoon completely away from noisy cars, and shopping-markets where is just the 2 of you, watch classical movies at the cinema under the stars, eat ice-cream for free at any time of the day, then you must choose your destination for Six Senses Laamu.  We have been there, and it was indeed... Paradise... That you everybody there for make it real!"
"I highly recommend the six senses resort .. It is amazing and it has a different concept from other resorts in Maldives .. What I liked The most is hiring a certain person who takes care of everything you want .. Also they have so much to do inside the resort so if your planing to go with your kids to Maldives this is what you want .  The staff are very friendly and helpful what I liked the most is the phenomenal coordinations between the departments they make things look so easy and smooth .. The spa is amazing , food is great .. The water villas are just what we want to relax it was a dream   "
"This is one of the very few places we have visited in our lives which have exceeded expectation. Very few places look just as amazing in person as they do in pictures, I'd argue that Six Senses Laamu may even look even better in person than they do in the incredible pictures I've seen online.   We went for our honeymoon and would honestly rate it 10/10 for every possible feature"
"We stayed for a week and found the whole experience very good indeed.  Our room on jetty A was perfect with all the facilities we needed and the level of privacy we wanted.  The outside shower was delightful and the easy access to the sea from the outdoor areas was great.  We loved the bikes, riding round the island daily, and walking along the beaches.  The food was excellent and we were taken round the main kitchens and they were superb; beautifully clean and organised.  The staff were lovely at all levels, our GEM was attentive without being intrusive and contributed much to our enjoyment.  We had a small need for a doctor while there and he was prompt and efficient.  A great hotel in a wonderful location.  Don't hesitate - go!"
"Maldives is always our dream destination & now with CX direct from HK, it got much easier! Six Senses Laamu had raised the bar in terms of services & property among many top resorts chain we had stayed in Asia & even among its sister property! Love to jump straight into the crystal clear Indian Ocean with corals under our villa, enjoy a private BBQ dinner on the beach, open air movie under the stars, dolphin/turtle watching by the hotel water...most of all, our friendly & helpful GEM (Guest Experience Maker) Shane & Yuki who had made everything seamless & memorable. Will definitely come back soon!"
"Wonderful 9 days/8 nights at Six Senses with my husband. From arrival to departure everything was flawless!   To start with, our Air India flight was almost 3 hours late arriving Male so we missed our connection. Six Senses rep was waiting for us at Male helped with luggage, explained when the next flight out would be and showed us to airport lounge where could wait (wifi, snacks, drinks - very comfortable). Luckily we only waited for 2 hours for small plane flight to Kadhdhoo airport and then a quick 15 minute speed boat ride to resort. Again, Six Senses reps along the way assisting and in boat provided bags for our shoes and cold drinks.  On arrival, we were immediately met by our GEM (guest experience manager) Afrah. Account it was late evening, Afrah gave us a brief‚Ä¶"
"We were staying in Beach villa 95. One of the nearest to the resort facilities. Everything at the resort is 10 out of ten - we loved it. The resort itself - buildings, layout, quality of the food, service, our villa rooms was magnifique. Our GEM was Inaz - he did a fantastic job looking after us - nothing was too much trouble. Petra and Marc in the Dive Shop, whom we had first met at VakuraFaulk in the South Ari Atoll some 13 years ago, really looked after us and gave us all the help we needed.

"We were staying at Six Senses Laamu for ten days. Staff, Food and of course the property itself were simply amazing. Six Senses Laamu has the friendliest, happiest and most caring staff we've ever experienced in a Hotel. Food was excellent and we had some special dining experiences (lobster beach dinner). Before dinner we usually had a drink at the bar and nearly every day there was a group of dolphins passing just right in front of the hotel. Just snorkeling around the house reef we got the see turtles, sharks, eagle rays and sting rays and even an octopus. Our GEM was also great and made sure we had everything we needed for a great stay at the hotel. It took as a very long time to decide on a hotel in the Maldives and we were so more than happy with our choice!"
"It's amazing both their services and the resort property. Lots of activities at the resort, close to the nature. I'd highly recommended this place for everyone and hope i have a chance to come back there again."
"We had stayed at Six Senses in Nha Trang and Laamu definitely exceeds its sister property, the staff are extremely friendly and helpful especially Shane, our GEM (Guest Experience Maker) and Yuki, The property is one of the most beautiful resort we had ever stayed (and we had stayed in many top resorts in Asia and Europe)and Maldives is definitely a paradise on earth!"
"I'd done a fair bit of research before choosing Six Senses and did so because of the consistently high ratings/comments/recommendations. I wasn't disappointed. Getting to the resort takes quite a big effort, but it's worth it although the planned introduction of a Sea Plane service later this year will definitely improve things. We stayed as a family of five in two adjacent Ocean Beach villas for one week. It's clearly very subjective but I'm glad we chose land based villas as it gave a lot more privacy (surrounded by thick vegetation and semi-private area of the beach) and more space than the water villas and the view from Ocean Beach villas (open ocean and neighbouring islands) and beach quality is much better than the Lagoon villas (from which you mainly see the water‚Ä¶"
"We had such a great experience during our time there.   The hotels is full of activities and always keeping us busy.   We actually came back and remember that we didn't really spent much time just sitting and chilling like what we usually do at the beach at all. We mostly run around from one activity to another all the time which was great.   We went out for a snorkeling and surfing trip with Ocean Dimensions. Mr. Steve and Mr. Mode who are in the business took great care and gave us great advise. Our trip wouldn't be so blessed and completed without them. Great men!

"This was a honeymoon trip for my husband and I - we are really glad that we pick the Six Senses Laamu over all the choices we had!   Our entire trip was truly remarkable and we woke up feeling happy everyday. We were upgraded to the Laamu Water Villa and we stayed at Villa #16. It was at the far end of the jetty but we have no complains cycling around everyday. We really like the design and concept of the villa - the outdoor shower, the glass bath tub and basically everything. The bed was really very comfortable - by far the best one we ever slept on.   The resort encourages everyone to go barefoot and we truly welcome this idea :) Everyone is friendly and polite everywhere we go - you can sense the pride that everyone has to be working there.  We would like to specially say‚Ä¶"
"After a week spent on a liveaboard boat for a scuba-diving trip, my friends and I had a 7-hour layover before the domestic flight from KDO to Male, and we decided to spend half a day at the Six Sense Laamu to rest. It was definitely the best decision we made all week, and it made me want to stay at the Six Senses!   The great service was apparent from the start when we called the resort, and was transferred to the Manager who told us the rates for a half-day stay at the resort. The speedboard pick-up went seamlessly, arriving at our liveaboard vessel and whisking us away, James Bond style! Complimentary Wi-Fi onboard was a nice touch. I wished there were small cold wet towels available to refresh ourselves - this is something I particularly enjoyed when I stayed at the Four‚Ä¶"
"Our stay at Six Senses Laamu was simply sensational! This is an excellent resort that strives for excellence in the treatment of all guests but always with respect for the environment, the flora and fauna. The food is very tasty and varied. The landscapes are fantastic and the snorkling is very beautiful. All staff members are highly professional and kind, but we emphasize the maldivianes host, which are particularly friendly. A paradise in the Maldives; a paradise on earth! The location so isolated means that the stay is necessarily expensive! But that's the price to pay for staying in paradise! That¬¥s a place where we really would like to return one day!!!"
"My wife and I decided to treat ourselves to a stay for our 10th anniversary on the strong recommendation of a friend. Cannot speak too highly of the resort - everything about it is well thought out, our over water villa was simply fantastic and the whole experience was amazing. The service is exceptional and they go beyond the norm (even sourcing a battery charger for my camera) to make your stay truly memorable. The surrounding waters and snorkeling options will take your breath away. We will definitely go back and stay for longer next time."
"I‚Äôve been reviewing hotels on TA now since 2007 and thought I had seen it all.  Six Senses Laamu just blew everything else away ‚Äì this is slam dunk the best, most amazing overall experience we‚Äôve ever had anywhere, ever.   If you want the short version, then book it ‚Äì you won‚Äôt regret it.  Here is why :  I‚Äôve stayed at Six Senses properties before (this was the 4th trip) and to be honest I‚Äôve always been a bit suspicious of the whole ‚Äúexperience‚Äù thing that the company markets as it has come across as lip service to an idea which doesn‚Äôt always deliver.

The attention to detail sets this resort apart from others I have stayed in. Not only did our personal gem remember our names but most other staff did also. Little details such as having your own personal bike to get around on and having a no shoe option really made our stay relaxed and stress free. The food was amazing and the choice of wines outstanding. Definitely a place we would return to.
"We have just returned from this beautiful place.  This was our first trip to the Maldives.  We stayed for 8 days in a Laamu water villa with pool - end of Jetty B. The whole trip was perfect.  The resort is stunning and the accommodation was exactly what I expected.  Large, luxurious rooms and complete privacy. You would never have to leave the room if you didn't want to. Just awesome to wake up in the morning and jump straight into the beautiful ocean from the villa and relax in your own pool. Our GEM and all of the staff were so friendly and accommodating.  No request was an issue. Heaps of dining options with great food. Great relaxed atmosphere. The diving was varied and beautiful. The reef systems and clarity of the water was outstanding. If you don't want to dive, the‚Ä¶"
"Our experience as a family was superb from a to z, only with a few glitches on the way, which our promptly solved by a super professional and attentative staff... Really looking forward to come back and to exploit other Six Senses experiences somewhere else..."
"One of the best overall holiday experiences we've ever had. If you like the water this is place to come. The sea life was colorful and extremely diverse and definitely one of the best snorkeling sites ever! Everything clicked from the attention to detail, natural yet luxurious design, accommodations, food, location, services, etc... We stayed in one of the sunset ocean villas on jetty A. Having the ability to jump into the beautiful turquoise sea from the back of the villa was well worth the extra cost. The resort was very kid friendly and had lots of activities to keep them occupied. The restaurants are all excellent with a wide selection of offerings from savory Vietnamese to hearty, authentic Italian. The ice cream parlor is an added bonus! It's not cheap and food and‚Ä¶"
"We just returned from a 6-night stay at Six Senses Laamu. So far, our best vacation ever. Everything works extremely well - from the reservation to the check-out. While the resort is far from Mal√©, the additional trip (local flight + boat ride) is worth and the team will move heaven and earth to make this a short trip (believe me that they work very well with the schedules to minimize waiting time and potential delays). The General Manager and the rest of the team will welcome you upon your arrival to the island. It is very nice to walk without shoes during the whole stay and to use a bicycle as means of transport. Once you arrive, you are assigned a Guest Experience Maker (GEM), who will take care of you during your stay. We originally booked an Ocean Water Villa and were‚Ä¶"
"We already had very high expectations and this resort surpassed them!   We have got many amazing moments from this holiday, from watching a film under the stars to the fantastic snorkelling (including snorkelling alongside a giant turtle) to relaxing in the bars and of course the staff - who were faultless.  We stayed for 10 nights, with first 5 nights in a beach villa followed by 5 nights in a water villa.  We thought we would have preferred the water villa (wanting the full Maldivian experience), but in fact because the restaurants were mostly built over the water, you got this every day.  So on reflection we had a slight preference for the beach villa due to the extra privacy it afforded.  But to be honest, they were both fab.    The weather during our visit was fantastic,‚Ä¶"
"As a travel industry professional I am fortunate to visit a lot of places around the world and I say with hand on heart that the Six Sense is one of the best resorts I have stayed at. From the moment you get off the boat you are greeted by staff that are the chosen because they are the best at offering extremely polished customer service.  Our GEM, Ravah, was one of the best hosts one could ask for.  Not only helpful and proactive but really fun to hang out.  While it goes without saying that the facilities are amazing and the food is was exceptional what really impressed us was how much attention and genuine love our 18-month son enjoyed from the staff.  Corrie and the girls at the Den did a fantastic job caring for Xander. Highlights for us were Sunset Drinks at Chill bar‚Ä¶"
"It was the second stop in our honeymoon. Everything was perfect: the villas, the amenities, the restaurants, the social activities, the spa, the weather, the views, and specially, the staff. They are all charmful and unique. A great place to come back. The best time to go is in late November or December. "
Thank you for letting us visit your beautiful island and the staff there.  We had a varm welcome both from the people and the weather. Spesial thanks to GEM Ravah who took care of us from the beginning to the last day. Even after a 24 hrs travel from Norway our 10 days stay was of the best.
"Everything was perfect, It's amazing hotel!!!! unforgettable moments: 42 flavors of Ice cream, movie under the stars, snorkeling, diving, dolphin cruise, .....so much fun. It's paradise  Hotel team are very professional, reliable, friendly and helpful. Best regards Housam & Kate"
"Went there for our 25th anniversary.   Absolutely magical in every way.   We arrived late at night by speed boat under the stars and were taken straight to our ocean villa by our GEM  ( Guest Experience Manager!).   Everything about the resort is amazing, from the barefoot policy  ( don't bring shoes!), to the spa,the villa, snorkeling in the clear blue waters, the staff and the food.  A place to fall in love again.   Can't recommend it enough."
"We went back to Laamu for a second time; at Christmas time again, with our 3 kids... and it did not disappoint.  The service, staff, natural surroundings, food, etc. were all fantastic.  Management made a few changes since last year which only improved an already spectacular hotel.  The management really responds to customer feedback.  We also had a much easier time getting from Male to Laamu this year... almost no waiting time at the airport in Male, which was great.  This year, we stayed our first few days in a two bedroom beachfront villa with pool.  It was so spacious, with a separate living room as well; two roof decks; and a large, outdoor bathroom area.  The pool was lovely, and it was only a few steps to the beach and ocean.  We enjoyed the villa very much, and it does‚Ä¶"
Six senses is definitly one of the best places I have ever been. The service is amazing and the scenery is beautiful. Great food and friendly people. Also a great place for diving. Saw mata's and lots of sharks Must Go. 
"After visiting the same island in the Maldives 18 times we decided it was time for a change. However, choosing a new island was no easy task as we have very specific travel requirements. We selected Six Senses Laamu after much correspondence. The service, attitude and professionalism was unrivalled and our trip when taken was wonderful! The attention to detail from all staff members shows that Six Senses have a very successful training procedure.  We are now in the process of booking our return trip with our daughter, her husband and our grandson in 9 months time."
"My husband and I stayed for a week at the resort for our honeymoon- and had the most amazing and memorable time. The staff was accommodating, and friendly. We felt at home the second day in. Everything from the food, to room service and laundry was amazing and full of sweet surprises.The food was fresh and tasteful with a variety of different foods. We will definitely be coming back as well as recommending the resort! "
"We stayed quite long time back and it was such an amazing stay, the weather was very good clear sky nice snorkelling. We arrived late night and we got surprised that our villas not next to each other and we asked to be next to each other, they called someone and in a while we met with Mina who is such a professional and hospitalised person, he listened to our concern and solve the issue and this is the start of our great vacation at Six Senses Laamu, being met with such a professional way gave us the indication that our vacation will be great one and this is exactly what we are looking for. The food is amazing, spa is wonderful and leaf restaurant you should not miss it when you are there. management checking on you and Mina is making sure that we are alright. Picnic island is‚Ä¶"
"here it is, been traveling a lot for short breaks but what makes Six Senses Laamu so especial is how the staff are treating their guests, great customer service! one person stood out among the rest at the front office, Mr. Mina  the manager who is so approachable and nice and will do extra mile just to satisfy the guest needs. Truly an amazing place, great food and exemplary staff they have at Six Senses Laamu."
"I'm back home in the UK after a week in paradise: in harmony with the best of nature; gentle welcoming people; respect for our environment; a sea the colour of which I've never seen before; a reconnection with the spirit; time to breathe and decompress. Jump on your bike and cycle from your exquisite overwater villa to yoga, diving, the spa, some stand up paddle board, cinema under the stars and more. Leave your shoes at home and chill in the perfect heat. Six Senses Laamu truly indulges each of those senses. I feel cleansed and at peace. A cooling lemongrass scented flannel and a warm smile greet you at the beach or on arrival at a bar or restaurant. This is a relatively large property but it never feels that way. Join this loving community from all over the world who'll take‚Ä¶"
"We stayed for the first week in March for our 20th wedding anniversary and were lucky enough to have our beach villa upgrade to one with a pool (yes).  Don't want to rabbit on about the quality of the food, the free ice cream, etc.  You can take it for granted based all of the other reviews (yes?).  Staff are great and any hiccups are fixed quickly (yes).    We only had 2 issues:  Did the Italian wine & food dinner in the wine cellar - great food and atmosphere, but too cold even with the jackets and hot water bottles they provide.  I gather they are going to turn off the air con in future based on our response (we had to leave and take our coffee on the steps outside).  They fog the beach villas for mosquitos so make sure you find out when they are so you are not there when it‚Ä¶"
"We recently returned from Six Senses Laamu; going in, we knew pretty much what to expect because we had previously stayed at the Six Senses Yao Noi in Thailand, and we had very high expectations--which were exceeded.  The Six Senses philosophy is very ""green""--sustainable furnishings, no plastic bottles (or really plastic anything, including straws), growing much of the food for the restaurants in their own gardens, etc.  And we believe that it works beautifully!  We were met at the airport at Kadhdhoo by our GEM (Guest Experience Maker) Inaz, who made our time at Laamu particularly wonderful.  (By the way, we had wanted to go to Maldives for decades, but the extremely long flights from the USA deterred us; consider making it a part of a vacation in Singapore (still long‚Ä¶"
"Well what can you say, this place is fantastic, we had the most wonderful holiday ever, they looked after us from start to finish and the attention to detail is far superior to any other holiday we have ever been on, the staff are amazing and friendly, nothing is to much trouble, and the food was fantastic and a real culinary delight. The leaf is an amazing restaurant in the trees, and the menu is changed daily and is small but perfect, the food is all organic, all the other 3 restaurants have fantastic fresh and healthy food. The water villa we requested was also fantastic with a pool and very well furnished with every thing you could ever want for your stay, with beautiful sunrises waking you up every morning. Our only fears of being noisy over the water and this keeping us‚Ä¶"
"Its the perfect place to go to .its paradise .the rooms and the location and the view are all amazing and so perfect. The staff there are so helpful . If you want to experience hospitality and cleanness and nice food,this is the place you have to seak. I have been there now for four times and i always feel its my home there.i am looking forward to go there again."
"Although getting to Lamu was quite a journey ( it should be easier soon once the sea planes fly direct ), the experience we had at this island resort was worth the journey. Honestly we can not think of any shortcomings in any area of the hotel's operation. Having a GEM (Guest Experiience Maker) assigned to every guest was a delightful surprise. Yassir was our dedicated GEM and he did his best to make sure we enjoyed our stay. Definitely coming back soon !"
"Whatever I say is beyond the imagination!  1-Location, view, water, beach 10/10 2-Rooms spectacular, clean 10/10 3-Staff and customer service maybe I should say 20/10 even this not enough! I never ever seen great customer service and friendly staff like this resort! Special thanks to Nozomi, Trevo, Di Di, Mojo, Nasroo, Dill this only the names I remember!  Thanks again Six senses laamu for the great holiday!  I'll be back :)  Cheers George"
"Amazing View, Service:))) Wish can stay longer.. The best romantic, relaxing, beautiful place ever!!! Clear blue lagoon, u can see all type of fish also can meet turtle!!!awsome place for the diver!! Don't miss out!!!"
"Fantastic place lovely service staff, great food. A little far from male but would still visit again. The kids club staff were wonderful and made my daughter so happy.she hasn't stopped talking about the Maldives over a year later and we've been to other places since "
"Such an amazing place. I rarely write reviews and only rate places with excellent service or outstanding decor these days as once it's a 5 star hotel most places are pretty much the same. Lovely waiting staff. Cheerful eager to help, really treated the resort as their home and appeared proud to show it off. The flight was delayed on the way in from male and I was super grumpy but our villa butler even managed to turn my frown into smiles. "
"The resort is gorgeous and the water divine, but that's not what defines Six Senses Laamu. If you avail yourself of all Six Senses has to offer, you will come back transformed. The food was exceptional. The cheeses were to die for. The wait staff - beyond words. Our waiter Hisham knew what we wanted even when we didn't. He made suggestions and brought small surprises of things we didn't know we wanted and then couldn't live without. Every meal felt like an event. Dr. J and the spa staff are extraordinary. If there is a service that they offer - health screening, body treatment, class - don't hesitate, jump!  We did virtually everything they offered and were enriched daily. It may seem pricey until you experience it and realize how greatly the value exceeds the cost.  Kunchok‚Ä¶"
My wife and I were on our honeymoon and the moment we stepped off the boat we were greeted with warm smiles and hospitality. Our GEM was amazing! Gave us a tour and brought us to our amazing vila over the water! We will never forget the wonderful experience and the amazing warmth we felt while we were in paradise.
"My husband and I traveled here for our honeymoon. The property is gorgeous, there is nothing to fault (other than the small bump, read on to find out).  Pros: Its a gorgeous property, the organic restaurant is amazing. Everything is brilliant. The food, the staff, the free icecream!   We stayed in the water villas and its was really comfortable too.   Cons: It is really far from the Male Airport. On the way in we had a stopover and finally the destination, on our way out there were two stopovers. Given that we were going from Bombay, the fact that it took us almost close to 8 hours to reach from Bombay to the property :(  Travel tips: (1) Use their one time laundry service, its cheap and you don't have to carry dirty laundry back;  (2) Take the boat and go to their main‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses Laamu Resort in the Mladives is truly amazing & exceptional. They scored a perfect 10 in each and every  categories that we feel are important such as eco-friendliness, romance, luxury, style, room, food, staff, service, design & natural beauty. If you like rustic, eco-friebdly, under-stated luxury, sophisticated staff and gorgeous natural surroundings, then this is definitely the one for you. This resort is definitely as good as my pre-trip research, and then some. Our GEM (Guest Experience Maker), Mr. Yasir, was very helpful, anticipative, creative & very resourceful. In short, lots of thanks to Mr. Yasir & the entire staff made our stay a very memorable & unforgettable one.

"We stayed at Six Senses on Laamu and had an incredible experience.  The resort's design was beautiful and soothing.  The spa personnel and services couldn't have been better.  The food was excellent.  The amenities, including bicycles with each villa, were thoughtful and plentiful.  A great vacation!"
"This was our first time in the Maldives and we are so happy we chose Six Senses Laamu for our 10-day honeymoon stay. We were met by our GEM Yasir (HI YASIR!!!) who brought us to our villa, which we requested to be on Jetty C, the most private out of the 3 Jetties. We stayed at Villa 77. It was just perfect.  We miss waking up to the ocean waves and beautiful sunrises every morning before heading for breakfast. Not to mention, the 1 crab who always greeted us on our deck every morning!  From our villa, the bike ride was about a 6 minute bike ride--which was one of our favorite parts about our honeymoon! Being greeted by staff as we biked through the path, saying hello and Good Morning was so great. We also were greeted by many tiny lizards, ranging from different colors, which‚Ä¶"
"I would like to thank all Laamu Staff for having transformed a nice Holiday in Maldives an a special , unic and fantastic Holiday in a wonderful Resort like Laamu Six Senses. It was my and my wife 6th time in Maldives, the last three in Soneva Fushi and we were looking for something with the same basic pholsophy with a scecial care to the enviroment. Honestly we were positively impressed not only because we have founded what we were looking for but, in addition we had the general filling to be in a ""Family"" and all people, starting from our GEM Irene, the Hostess, with a special mention for Java and the waiters, special mention also for  Hashim, were so kind and taking care of us in a special way.

"This was our first trip to the Maldives. It's been a dream to stay in a water villa and after much research Maldives was ultimate location. In this research Six Sense seemed to pop up on top/best list and recommended by travel agent. The overall experience was out of this world. We arrived at Male quite late and we had to stay in Male for one night, waking up at 8:00am and transferred to airport where we met with a Six sense staff member before boarding a domestic plane at 10:00am. Then we were take by speed boat to the resort after 20 minutes, invited to engage in no shoe philosophy and given lemonade. Arriving on island we were greeted by the general manager, GEMS and executive chief. Guests are all assigned with a GEM, guest experience manager who take care of you from‚Ä¶"
"This is our third visit to Maldives in 4 years. We had been to Four Seasons Kuda Huraa and Conrad Rangali, though this was our first water bungalow stay in Maldives.  The overall experience was excellent and wonderful.  We arrived at Male quite late and we had to stay in Male for one night, waking up at 0445 and transferred to airport around 6, hoping on a plane at 0730. Then we were take by speed boat to the resort after 20 min.  We are a family of 5. My wife and I are keen divers. My two boys aged 10-12 and grandpap aged 80 stayed in another villa. Our Villas were opposite to each other at Jetty B.  The villa per se was unbeatable: spacious, well equipped, cozy and clean. There are steps and stairs within the villa, so pay extra attention with the seniors and during nighttime.‚Ä¶"
"We returned to Six Senses Laamu within one year after our first visit. We had never returned to any resort before, but SSL ticked all the boxes, hence we decided to give it a try.  It was great to be back and we felt very welcome with many employees remembering who we were and greeting us with great enthusiasm. The 3 bedroom beach villa (nr 87/88) was at least as good as in our memories and we truly appreciated that the hotel took note of a few points for improvement to the villa that we made during our first visit. It is the perfect villa for a family or couples traveling together with a great pool and a large stretch of beach from which you can see both the sunrise and the sunset. Highlights of our stay: true hospitality in a very relaxt environment, beautiful and large pool‚Ä¶"
"Just came back from the holiday in Six Senses Laamu. It was really a nice place managed by an excellent team. All the staff here are so helpful and they made us feeling just like staying at home. We would like to give our special thanks to our GEM - Shane. She is always so cheerful and timely handle our questions. If we really need to say something for improvement, we would recommend the hotel to improve a bit in the quality & variety of Chinese cuisine. Or they can consider to offer more variety of Asian foods as the best alternative. "
"I've had the most amazing hotel experience EVER, at the Six Senses Laamu resort. From the time I arrived in Male to the time I left the resort, I've had the biggest smile on my face from pure happiness.   Arrived at Male and was greeted by a Six Senses staff member. He escorted me to the airport lounge, where I waited for my domestic flight to depart. We landed at Kadhdhoo airport where another staff member awaits to board us on the speedboat (here we removed our shoes for our entire stay at the resort!). We arrived at the resort after a 20 min. ride or so and was greeted by the resident manager and was introduced to our Guest Experience Maker (GEM). ""Haanif"" was my GEM and he showed me around the resort before bringing me to my Lagoon Villa.   I stayed in room #38 on Jetty B‚Ä¶"
"The spa was a real highlight - outstanding therapists, great natural products and a beautiful setting. The water villas are also stunning and let nature be the star of the show with outdoor shower, transparent over water tubs and even viewing space in the loos! Love that they are trying to reduce carbon footprint with dedicated raw menus, using glass instead of plastic and have a recycling programme which they teach kids about."
"Am amazing experience from the moment we arrived in Male airport. Staff was exceptional and the property beautiful. The small things - like the staff greeting you every time, remembering your names and preferences, always keen to share a story but not being obtrusive made all the difference. A beautiful property where you felt alone and had enough privacy in the rooms. "
"There are plenty of luxury resorts in the Maldives, but secluded Six Senses Laamu takes barefoot chic to a new level. The resort, though immensely luxurious, manages to have a down-to-earth vibe that starts when you're met by the resort manager and your own personal GEM (Guest Experience Maker) at the dock upon arrival. I was tickled to see personalized (woodburned!) license plates on my villa's bicycles - just one of the many thoughtful touches that makes Six Senses beyond special. The villa itself was lovely. With a jaw-dropping ocean view and beautifully furnished deck (including an outdoor shower and glass over-water bathtub), it was tempting to just stay in and order room service for the entire stay. Wisely, I ventured out and sampled the excellent restaurants, enjoyed a‚Ä¶"
"Very pleasant,comfortable facilities with as much or as little as you want to do.Service & attention by staff exceptional. Quality of food good to very good. Drinks very good with excellent wine list but high priced & extra 25% makes even pricier. Transfers handled expertly by staff."
"Great experience in one of the most beautiful places in the world for relax and holidays. The environment, service, restaurants, etc. were all of very high quality and the accommodation was excellent. We can only strongly recommend this place."
Very pleasant visit - very luxurious and the service very special for 10 days. Looked after very well by our designated GEM . Also appreciated numerous staff services . Would recommend this resort as most comfortable and appealing.
"This gorgeous place is paradise. Perfect water, wonderful staff and amazingly delicious and fresh food. Go to the trouble it takes to get to this remote spot!! Off of the villas on the jetties is the world's biggest and most beautiful swimming pool, complete with turtles."
"We have just spent 8 nights at the Six Senses Resort at The Laamu Atoll. Quite simply, the location is stunning, the people and service of the highest calibre, and the food exquisite. We had an Ocean Beach Villa with pool.  Plenty to do on the island if you want activities. I can personally recommend the dive centre. I took my PADI Open Water qualification during my stay and was looked after really well. They are a great team.  There is a fantastic spa, with a full range of therapies and rituals.  There are a number of places to eat on the island, our favourite being The Leaf restaurant. Top class.  I could go on and on, but I think you get the drift.  Overall, an excellent resort. One not to be missed."
"I visited the Six Senses Laamu in December 2015 with my wife and two daughters.  We stayed in neighbouring ocean villas and had a great time.  The resort is very relaxing and one of the best places in the world to get away from city life and truly unwind.  The architecture and interior design is very much in line with and complimentary of the environment and helps you relax.  If you are into water sports then there are plenty of things to do including snorkelling and scuba diving.  The highlight of our stay was the spa; there are lots of treatments and we especially enjoyed the bespoke treatments, it was definetely one of the best Six Senses spas we have been to. Special thanks to Dr. J & Dr. G and their whole team, who took care of us.   It was also great to have a butler, on‚Ä¶"
"Can't say enough good things. Fabulous rooms, service throughout was fantastic and an amazing setting. Abdullah, our gem made sure we were well looked after and staff in the restaurant were fantastic and friendly. The food was fantastic, especially the leaf restaurant. They have done an amazing job of making the experience luxurious and retaining the jungle and natural feel of the island. Even when it rains, they put on a rain day timetable including back of house tours and wine tastings, which were great. They have a great spa, gym and complementary classes. We loved the cinema under the stars and there was even a 1k jungle jogging route, so we could burn some of the million calories we were stuffing down! Oh - and did I mention the 42 flavours of free ice cream at their‚Ä¶"
"Great spot to flop and dive after a pretty hectic trip to Delhi, Calcutta, Hyderabad and Chennai. Dive sites excellent. On my first two days I saw a leopard shark from 3m, four turtles, a smallish reef shark, lion fish, a leaf fish and a napoleon wrasse, a moray eel as well as lots diverse reef fish. Coral in comparatively good shape. Not many divers. If heard the southern atoll was better for diving and my experience is that is true."
"From the time we landed at Male, we were well taken care of by the ground staff of Six Senses, all the way on transit on the speed boat!!   We practically think of nothing we can fault. Nothing at all. Well done guys!!   The saddest part of the trip is to wave good bye to everyone at the jetty. "
"From the moment we arrived until the day we left we couldn't have asked for more.  The place is amazing.  The staff, the accommodation, the food, in fact the whole experience was just what we were looking for.  Although it is 5 star it was so laid back and relaxing. No dressing for dinner, no makeup, no heels ...  Bliss.  We shall be returning."
"The hotel, its staff, and the wonderful attendance we received during our stay at Six Senses Laamu was really superb!!...they really made us to feel at a paradise on the earth.....highly recommended for all that appreciate nature, quality and kindness!!!"
"The Maldives are definitely pricey. Six Senses is no exception. As an Aussie, its expensive to get there and its expensive to stay there. For us, we went to celebrate a special occasion. It is really hard to choose a resort. The atolls of the Maldives are all sublime in their own way; each resort has some hook or feature to entice you.  Our main requirement was an over water villa. We wanted character, not a hotel room, not too close to other villas and not too many of them. Six Senses is all of that. Added to this is an impossibly perfect representation of the ideal tropical island. White sand, turquoise waters and lush tropical bush with sandy tracks to walk, run or ride around. I think our first Facebook post said something about finding heaven. The lagoon is fantastic to‚Ä¶"
"Having travelled the world quite extensively, i can honestly say this is the best resort i have ever stayed in.  Location, facilities and staff were all first class.  From the moment you take your shoes off on their launch, through walking /cycling through their leafy paths or swimming / snorkelling in the crystal clear warm waters you feel totally relaxed. The breakfasts are sublime and all the restaurants we tried served excellent food.  The layout of the overwater lodges provides luxurious privacy as well as easy access to the riches of the lagoon. If you get the chance try diving - i saw numerous turtles, rays, my first grey reef shark and was privileged to be treated to a close encounter with a manta ray.  There are too many great staff to mention, but Oleg and Magherita‚Ä¶"
"I stayed at the end of November and loved every second of it. The weather was perfect and it only rained overnight. The food, service, room, beach, snorkling were all amazing. It was my birthday while I was there and was made to feel soo special. I wish all the smiling faces there every day. I really believe this is the best resort in the Maldives and I would go back again"
"We stayed for our honeymoon in Jan '16 for one week. The staff were very attentive, helpful and friendly. All answering questions we had about the local islands etc  Hotel dive centre staff were great and and facilitated beautiful dives seeing Manta Ray and sharks.  Food is brilliant. Drinks are expensive, but they always are in locations and places like this. Could not fault the water villa we had. The excursions are rather expensive  for what they offer would be the only downside to this brilliant hotel"
"We've just returned from 9 days in Six Senses, Laamu, a perfect holiday.  We went for rest and relaxation after months of stress and illness. There's loads to do if you want to be active but we didn't. The best bits were the bicycles to ride round the island, the choice of restaurants, including a wellness menu and the very best spa and therapists who were beyond wonderful. They massaged away all our stress. it's our 4th Six Senses holiday and by far the best. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff. The service is second to none and the spa beyond wonderful.  We can't wait to return."
"It was truly amazing the staff are very friendly and very helpful. The restaurants are unbelievable, my favourite restaurant was Leaf. Water was crystal clear and the bungalows are  stunning.  Would recommend anyone to visit six senses laamu "
The six senses Laamu is the most beautiful place I have ever been. It is the perfect mix of luxury and rustic bohemian.  I did a lot of research before booking the six senses and it definitely lived up to my expectations.  Upon arrival we were greeted by all the main staff members of the hotel and assigned a personal butler.  Ours was named Yuki and she was awesome.  She made sure that everything was handled for us and that we were happy at all times.  She was great!    We stayed in lagoon villa 5 for the first few nights and then (because we booked with Mr. and Mrs. Smith) we were upgraded to the water villa 10.  They were both amazing.  The two differences were that 5 didn‚Äôt have any coral immediately under the villa so the water looked bright turquoise whereas 10 had a darker‚Ä¶
"My family and I went back recently to this exceptional hotel and found it still as excellent as the other three times we have visited. We had a villa over the sea near the house reef with stunning views and wonderfully easy access to a fabulous snorkelling site (saw turtles, bay reef sharks and a myriad of beautiful reef fish). The food and service are great and there is a professional but relaxed atmosphere. We also scuba dive and saw Manta ray and sharks, more turtles.... One of the highlights was just the four of us watching a late night movie on a nearby sand bank under the stars; a truly unique experience. Thanks to everyone there for making it such a special trip"
"It' a marvelous location with a strong ecofriendly culture. Perfect for relaxing and dedicate time to yourself doing yoga, meditation, diving or snorkeling. We have been at Six Senses in January 2016 whole family with two kids.  The kids club is very nice, our kids liked it a lot and spend some time in the afternoon while we where doing yoga. Personnel very efficient and nice.  We had both a beach Villa and after an overwater Villa: both are very beautiful. Our GEM (guest experience maker) Shifu has been always kind and affixing, Thank you!  Unfortunately the weather was not so good, we 4 days out of 9 with rain/ cloudy weather. Food and excursions are very expensive. If like to eat, you better do full board.  I didn't like that you can't enjoy room service if you are in‚Ä¶"
This place was spectacular. It will leave you speechless. A honeymoon never to forget and I would recommend it to be a number 1 honeymoon destination. What you see in the pictures is what you get. Crystal clear water. No photo shop here. The food is divine with so many options to choose from. All inclusive buffets or dinner on the beach. Such a romantic place and would definitely love to revisit one day.  
I have never been to a place more divine.  I have been back home for 3 days now and I'm still dreaming of the sound of the ocean in the morning from our Lagoon water villa. The attention to detail was spectacular: from the Eco-friendly design to the politeness and grace of the staff to the stunning beauty of the setting to the host of wonderful activities to the delicious free ice cream .... This was a Disneyland for sea/ nature lovers and just humans in general! An unforgettable honeymoon - we are spoilt for life!  
"The attention to detail is amazing, nothing is forgotten, the room, location, food service was absolutely the best, we couldn't fault anything , it was great to have your own bike to get around on, going barefoot for the entire stay was so relaxing, I hated to put my shoes back on. All of the staff recognized you after the first day and went out their way to assist and be helpful, the f&b manager was around at all meals in every venue she really was on top of everything. Lastly but not least the surprise at turn down service for my birthday was beautiful."
"I wanted something special for my wife's 30th birthday and this was it!  Our stay was truly magical. Everything from beginning to end was simply excellent. As soon as our boat arrived there, we were greeted by the General Manager and her team which was a special feeling. We were assigned our own 'Guest Experience Maker' (GEM) who was terrific.   The food with its fusion of eastern and western cuisines had a great twist. The restaurant staff were excellent. Our GEM booked us at a different restaurant every evening and they were all as good as each other.   You can rent snorkeling equipment from the shop on site and eat as much ice cream as you want. We went for diving (first time ever!) with Margarita and she made everything very simple and put us at ease.  The restaurants, spa,‚Ä¶"
"Room, food, service, location, ambience, absolutely first class. Barefoot policy surprisingly enjoyable! Very visible and friendly senior management. Overall one of the most pleasing, efficient and helpful teams I have ever encountered. The place and the people exude charm. Dive and surfing organisation and instruction excellent. Facilities fabulous. Our water villas amazing.  A family holiday with 4 boys aged 23, 19, 17 and 13 - a week's R&R at Laamu after 12 days touring in Sri Lanka. Possibly the last time we will all be away on a big trip together and we were delighted with our choice of Six Senses. It was arguably as close to perfect as you can get."
"We have visited many islands but this is the only one we have returned to. We have two weeks in the Maldives and visit 2 islands each for a week. The six senses has been our second island 4 times in last 5 years.  It is just a step above many other islands, the service is wonderful, there is a new pool this year complete with pool bar which provides a wide range of lunches, from pizza (which my husband loved as he could have as many toppings as he wanted) to crisp refreshing salads. The pool area is a really good location to watch the sunset from. Restaurants - there are a few options but we love The Leaf, for us the presentation and quality of the food is superb. Breakfast watching the turtles swim by is truly amazing. This time we stayed in a ocean water villa (no 21) a really‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses Laamu. How should I begin?  You've seen the pictures of the overwater villas... either in a magazine, or online... you've dreamt what it must be like to vacation there.... the seed is already planted in your head.... what kind of vacation is this going to be???  THE MALDIVES!!!!!  (If you've heard this trip compared to ‚ÄúFantasy Island‚Äù- it's not far off!!!!!) I'll begin with a very long flight.  It is literally halfway around the world, and 15-20 hours on an airplane depending on how you go (from Los Angeles).  There are airport layovers, too... but we won't dwell on any of that.  When we got the the Male International Airport (Maldives) a representative from Six Senses found us, and helped us get ourselves and our stuff to where we needed to be for the next small‚Ä¶"
"This was our third stay at a Six Senses resort and just like the others we‚Äôve visited it was barefoot luxury in the true sense - we left the shoes the first day and didn't use them again until we left - divine food, excellent service, beautiful villas on the beach and on the water, great snorkeling and other water activities. The setting and eco- friendly design touches throughout the property make it special, but what‚Äôs really outstanding is the incredibly personal and friendly service. We sincerely felt the hospitality from the management to the staff the moment we arrived. Everyone went out of their way to make us feel like extra special guests and make our visit absolutely the best experience for the whole family. Things like allowing us to stay at a water villa for the‚Ä¶"
"best trip ever - property was beautiful, staff incredibly helpful and the perfect place to do nothing for 10 days but relax. Snorkelling incredible... everything.We would absolutely go back again  - had the experience of the villa on the beach with pool and the villa on the water with pool. "
All round very good.  Amazing setting. Kids club is one of the best encountered.  Our 7 year old was very happy and busy.  First class girls working there.  Kids activities also amazing! Zen food is excellent. Food generally is very good inc the Asian offering. Villas are very good. Wine list is good. Service generally is good. Snorkelling etc good. Gym was too hot.  Needs sorting. Needs a separate adults only lap swimming pool. Needs better bandwidth on WIFI. In one of our villas there were far to many flies.  That definitely needs sorting. I am not so convinced the whole GEM set up is necessary.  Does anyone buy this shared host stuff anymore? Overall 8.75 out of 10 but I rarely award score over 8.
"From the moment we arrived at the arport, we were greeted by Six Senses staff. Our bags were tag and all we had to worry was ourselves. Upon arrival at Six Senses island, we were informed there is a 'no shoes' policy. You can choose to join and be bare feet all the time or if you prefer shoes, it is your choice. We had a welcome drink and off we went on a 20 min speed boat ride to the resort.  You dont have to worry about your bags anymore, they were sent to the room and a GEM (Guest Experience Manager) is assigned to you to help with meal bookings, activities, anything else you need practically. Bicycles are prepared for you to move around the island with ease. Meals are available at different restaurants.   For family with kids, there is an ice cream bar available to keep your‚Ä¶"
"This was our 4th stay in a Six Senses (Zighy Bay, Con Dao, Yao Noi before) and we were not disappointed. As the ones before as well Laamu is located at an incredibly beautiful place. There was nothing missing! A choice of different restaurants with excellent food, great personnel with a very attentive but relaxed service, an amazing villa with a beautiful view on the beach and the Indian Ocean.We enjoyed every minute of our stay! For the ones traveling with kids: it was a long and exhausting journey for our son of 2 years but on the island he felt really at home. We would not recommend a water villa with kids that age but with the beach villa it's very easy going and absolutely not to worry."
Worked very well families and honeymooners. Excellent kids club they are wanted to go.Food very good although very expensive - go half board. Service very good with individual concierge. House reef very good.
"Six Senses Laamu is a unique place, not your typical Maldives Resort. The setting and eco- friendly design touches throughout the property make it special but it is really the staff who take it to the next level. You will sincerely feel the hospitality from the management to the staff the moment you step in this resort. Everywhere you look, instagrammable. Incredible culinary offerings, masterfully created that you will feel the love of the Chefs in every bite I had. I‚Äôve worked in the hotel industry and know that genuine customer service lies on the hotel‚Äôs staff shared vision to surprise and delight the guest in every encounter. I am truly amazed and proud for their strong advocate of sustainable tourism.  I commended the effort of FO Manager Mina and his cohesive team for‚Ä¶"
"We've just recently come back from the Paradise. Six Senses Laamu is forever in our heart! Our honey/baby moon turned out as the best vacation in our life so far.   We loved every single thing about the resort - warm meet&greet, amazing facilities, very professional friendly stuff, breathtaking sceneries and beautiful weather. We were spoiled by endless fun, relaxing atmosphere, family feel provided by the lovely people around...fine dining, awesome massages and treatments at the SPA, healthy drinks and lots of ice cream, swimming in turquoise water, snorkeling, kayaking, movies under the starry sky...take me back!

"Outstanding resort, great service. The staff are very personable and nothing is too much trouble for them. The food & beverages are high quality. Overall a special place to visit and highly recommended."
Yes this place is pricey but so is every 5star place in maldives.   Cannot fault hotel. Great boat speed ride to hotel and organised transfer on internal flight from male.  Pro's: (Pretty much all the things but should really name few!) Kunchok and Emily at spa were very nice and hlpful. Food was great even for the pedantic ones like us...vegetarians!!  Chef would make us whatever we wanted if nothing on menu was good enough. Cycles around resort was nice touch... Be careful not to go overboard!!! :) Free ice cream and sweets all day was great touch. Free snorkelling gear was good touch too. Library of books and DVDs were utilised. Free spa sessions/activities were great. Each room had a gem: guest services guy/girl. Gym and pool was great. Beaches were amazing. The water villas‚Ä¶
"We chose Six Senses after doing alot of research on choosing the right resort for us.We were not disappointed .From the moment we arrived at Male airport we were greeted by a Six Senses rep ,did not have to worry about a thing. After the transfer to the resort we were met by the friendly staff and our GEM Haniff who was on hand our whole time here ,nothing was too much trouble. The water villa was amazing the pictures don't do it justice ,could live there forever. The food was amazing no matter what time of the day you ate ,staff where on hand to make sure everything was to your liking.There was too many ice cream flavours to digest (42 in total) hopefully next time ,must try harder. We did a couples massage ,never experienced quite like it ,deep and relaxing .The spa is to die‚Ä¶"
We only went here last minute for 1 day but it is really perfect! We didnt want to leave because it was so beautifull and relaxing! Everything is really clean and the staff is helpfull. Food is really good and good portions. It is also a good snorkling place. We also want to thank Mina again for his service towards our situation in Gan!
"Amaizing thing for our family happened.  We decided to spend vacations in the same place for the second time.  That was in the 4-5 day of the first stay in Six Senses Laamu. The exact filling - I am to come back here for sure. That filling comes to you at home - when everything is organised in the best way, calm, cozy and free. You need no time to start relaxing. Just take off you working shoos - and it comes - the story of your rest begins! As same as ay home. There are many places to come, many places to see and admire. But the thing I know - when I`ll plan urban escape - my way leads to this place!  Great thanks for all Laamul crew - you managed to create the unique atmosphere! Wonderfull Ocean Dimension gays - Petra, Mark, Oleg and Hiromi.  Leaf restaurant team.  Spa‚Ä¶"
"This is a wonderful resort that I've ever seen. The most impressive to me that every equipments designed by wood.  We were lucky to experience picnic at private island where we enjoyed reading, swimming,  snorkeling and exploring...  We loved soaking up the sun but lots of complimentary activities were attractive( including free ice-cream üç¶ everyday). The staffs, views, landscapes, food, services were fantastic. We would like to many thanks to nozomi GEM for supporting us, He did the great job. Wish to go back laamu. "
"Just spent 6 days the resort. Staying at an overwater Vila with 2 children. If you crave calm  and at the same time activities to stop you becoming too bored, this is the perfect place. Even if you don't dive, there is a house reef  right on the doorstep- that's why it's the house reef - very easy for snorkeling and there is a huge variety of fish. We also saw turtles and eagle rays.   The diving was also very good and what is also impressive is the safety culture at the dive center. They know the are well and the energy of the dive guides was always there, even if they had dived the sites so many times. The main dive areas are not too far away and there is plenty of variety as well as a specialty Manta ray dive. There are also evening talks by the resident Manta specialist and‚Ä¶"
"It was my husband's birthday and his choice for destination. He picked the resort and the villa (which is the first time I've trusted him to pick and book holidays). We had the last pool villa (69) on Jetty C and whilst it was the farthest away from the resort facilities it was the most private and we did have push bikes to get around so no big deal. Never have I seen such blue water and white sand, simply amazing.   The resort itself was very well run, the staff professional and accommodating, the spa is a must do and the restaurants exceptional.  The villa was well fitted out with a Nespresso coffee machine (we love our coffee), in room breakfast was available however the selection in the restaurant was too good to say no to most days. We had a private deck to sit on, an open‚Ä¶"
"My wife and I took our 9 month old son to Six Senses Laamu and it essentially met all our expectations, which were very high given what I had heard about the Maldives. Scenery is stunning everywhere you look, service is immaculate from everyone, attentive staff everywhere with nothing ever too much trouble. The Spa is the best I've ever been too, with the bird's nest massage room looking out over the sea a real marvel. It was total bliss as a holiday. The Den was brilliant, where we could just drop our baby off for excellent care without notice and pay by the hour, this allowed us to have spa treatments or go snorkeling together - which is amazing. All in all, a magnificent holiday. The only negatives I would raise are twofold: The food is just ok. Not bad but just ok. Given‚Ä¶"
"Right from the place we landed at the airport.. we received great hospitality. The resort provides us daily activities and surprises even if you just stay inside the water villa(we are so delighted to received free upgrade to water villa with pool too).  An unforgettable honeymoon location for us. We received excellent services from all staff and We really love the place so much and we hope to come back someday together with our family again. All the best to Six Senses laamu keep up the good food , good ambiance , good spa ,  excellent services and fun water sports and activities!!!"
"We had the best time and can't wait to go back for another magical week!! The week was filled with swimming, snorkeling over a beautiful reef just feet off our over water villa, paddle boarding, surfing, riding our personalized bikes around the island, movies under the stars, delicious food, and relaxation. "
"Friends tell you about the Maldives before you get there. ""It'll ruin you for life"" is the most common quote we heard before the trip. Well, they were all correct and in no small part due to the team and amenities at Six Senses Laamu. From the moment you check in and introduced to the team the resort exceeds all expectations.   My wife and I stayed in a ""Lagoon Villa"" and it was stunning. The rooms are generously proportioned and the surrounding views of the ocean, reef and wildlife are breathtaking.   The food at Six Senses is also excellent with my appreciation for buffets reaching an entirely new level. For me a buffet generally looks good but on the whole is a bland experience regardless of price. Six Senses however have managed to pack quality and taste into every bite on‚Ä¶"
Great hospitality. You will never get bore even staying up to a week. The resort provided many facility and activities every day(even on raining). Services are just beyond our expectation.  It is definitely worth for the money we spent.
"If you want a truly relaxing holiday this is the place.It was so god we returned again this year. The rooms are beautifully designed.  The Water off of Jetty A is deeper and bluer but the peace and quiet of Jetty C and the fabulous bike ride home after dinner are hard to top.  The food is excellent and there are more than enough restaurants for a two week stay.  There is a buffet served a couple of nights in the main venue but if that is not your preference the bar, pizzeria by the pool,  leaf of the Japanese Restaurant are available.  The new pool (installed last Christmas is a great addition - although only 1.2m deep.  However,  it is the staff who really make this place. Their attention to detail and their clear wish to ensure you have the best possible holiday shines‚Ä¶"
"I absolutely loved Laamu, it is such an exciting and quirky destination with the most wonderful restaurants and just the most luxurious rooms. The over water villa I stayed in was absolutely stunning and I don't want to ruin the surprise - but the bathroom...wow!! I will definitely be back."
"We have just returned from a week at Six Senses Laamu and I have to say it was one of the best weeks of my life! Being located in the Southern part of the Maldives lent itself to outstanding marine life and an absolutely stunning setting. We travelled with Qatar via Doha from Cape Town, and when we arrived we could barely keep it together. It was pure paradise. The welcome received from the airport with homemade lemonade on the boat (once we had done the domestic flight) as well as pieces of coconut where exactly what we needed after a long flight. The welcome at the resort was incredible with Frans the Resident Manager and various members of the team including your own GEM, responsible for making your stay an outstanding one! Our villa was absolutely incredible...on the water‚Ä¶"
"From the moment we arrived in the Maldives, we felt like VIP guests at this spectacular resort. The team effortlessly guides you through the transfer process, domestic flights, and before you know it - you're on the speed boat headed towards an island oasis. Jet lag quickly fades, and you're ready to begin your vacation.  There are so many activities to do at Six Senses Laamu. The snorkeling at the house reef is spectacular! The staff at the dive shop are world class - they know what they're talking about, the gear is in great condition, and they have Nitrox! We spent so much time in the water. We loved the kayak and paddle board rentals. All of the staff were so knowledgeable and helpful in pointing out great things to see and do. We road our bikes everywhere. And the spa was‚Ä¶"
"A real picture postcard place, what I'd imagined the Maldives to be in my dreams but never quite expected in reality. The staff were a total delight. There's loads to do but no pressure to do it, so you can very much take a holiday at Six Senses at your own pace."
"We had a great honeymoon and it felt like paradise! Wonderful resort, beautiful island, great service and excellent food. We enjoyed every minute and didn't want to leave! Thank you for this unforgettable expericence!"
The most amazing location and superbly professional management and staff make this the ideal resort in the Maldives. Great facilities for diving and snorkeling and mouth-watering food options all beautifully presented
"Our stay was truly magical. Everything from beginning to end was absolutely world class. As soon as you step onto the island its apparent how much effort has gone into creating the resort which is surely the best resort in the Maldives, This resort is certainly one of the best in the world and a must visit. From the time you arrive in Male and the arrival at the island is sheer LUXURY. Greeted by the General Manager and her team. The special welcoming feeling that you will not get it anywhere else except  Six Senses Laamu.   The food with its fusion of eastern and western cuisines had an exotic twist which was heavenly. All the staff at Chill, Longitude, Leaf, Sip Sip, and Zen - you are the gems to the resort and we cannot thank you enough for making us feel so welcome and‚Ä¶"
"We had the privilege of staying at Six Senses Laamu for my birthday and had the absolute best time. The service is impeccable - like nothing I've ever seen. From the moment we pulled up in the boat, we were greeted by the entire staff, welcoming us to their Indian Ocean home. Everyone is appointed a GEM, or guest experience manager, who grants your every wish.  The rooms are absolutely fabulous. We stayed in an overwater beach bungalow, which we highly recommend! It's a complete dream! From the heavenly beds to the outside porch complete with hammock, glass bottomed dining area, sun loungers, and steps down to the ocean. Completely private, completely romantic, completely luxurious.  The rest of the resort is just as fabulous. Ride your bike around the property and visit the‚Ä¶"
"As a couple who has seen many places, we were surprised to feel very blessed with our first trip to Maledives. Six senses lives up to anyone's highest standards. Staying in a water villa, we enjoyed snorkeling and swimming right in front of our terrace. The villas are beautiful, and there is none of the small things that somehow don't fit, and make you wish for another place next time: the room, outside shower, terrace, bed are perfect and spotless, all done in a beautiful, natural style. There is always fresh drinking water, lots of towels, the aircon is silent, the bed is extremly comfortable. My partner, an avid diver, claimed the dive center to be the best he has seen so far. I took up windsurfing and enjoyed the gym, which is high end and well air conditioned. We are‚Ä¶"
"We went for the last two weeks in October to this island. It is without question not only the best holiday we've ever had, but also the most outstanding resort we have ever been to. Everything about this island is perfect. We stayed in a beach bungalow with our own private pool. We had a little extra room for the kids. The bungalow was just amazing, it had everything you needed, and so much more, and had with the added bonus of being incredibly private. Beyond our bungalow we had the Indian ocean where we could see the sharks and eagle rays literally swimming past our feet. The attention to detail in this resort is second to none. It beats every other resort I have stayed at and I've been to 5 star resorts. The whole atmosphere was so relaxed and yet the service was the best we‚Ä¶"
"We went here for our 10th wedding anniversary. We thoroughly enjoyed staying here - very relaxed (no shoe policy helps to get in the holiday mood) with outstanding food and service. The over water villa was large and contained all amenities. The outdoor bathroom a fun experience. Each room is allocated bikes and we rode around the island to get to different areas (the island is only small and flat, so not strenuous). Not for those on a budget. Loved every minute of it."
"Choosing a resort to celebrate my birthday in Maldives was an easy choice knowing the level of service they provide. We did not feel that that they were just providing excellent services, they made us feel like coming home.   Although I arrived on the island with stomach flu and stayed in my room for two days, I felt the love and care constantly by the staff , checking on my well being. Dr. Ahmad the resort doctor took really good care of me.  Our GEM Ravah took care of us during the stay, he is really a GEM.  The resort have excellent range of restaurants and beautiful villas with lots of privacy . Their famous free ice cream place all day is a real treat.   It is definitely a place where you want to escape from the busy world. Lovely starred filled sky at night , if this is‚Ä¶"
"We have just returned from a week in heaven. No, the pictures do not do it justice. From the staff, the villas, the ethos, the food, the spa, just amazing. Impossible to pick out staff over others as they were all great. We did the 4 day introduction to Yoga, with the lovely Emily, and this consisted of a range of classes and treatments, my husband said it was the most relaxing holiday he has ever had. Mixed weather, but walking in the rain, through the puddles in bare feet, wonderful. I long to return...."
We travelled to Six Senses Laamu at the end of September/beginning of October for our honeymoon and it was utterly perfect. We were very lucky with the weather and only saw rain over night once - the rest of our 10 days was beautiful.  Irene was our Gem and she was fantastic - every time she saw us she would stop and chat and nothing was too much trouble for her - she made our trip! Thank you Irene!!!  The whole island is beautiful and traveling by bicycle is great fun - even though not all guests follow the rules when driving on the correct side of the path! We stayed in a lagoon water villa on Jetty C which was just what we requested - very quiet and super private. We are both strong swimmers so the current off our deck wasn't too much of a problem but if you are not that‚Ä¶
"We had another glorious 2 weeks at SIx Senses Laamu, made even better by the GM giving us an upgrade for the whole 14 nights. We were a bit unlucky with 5 days of rain in week 1 but it's still a beautiful place to be even in the rain. We loved the dive with the mantas, what an experience, and we did lots of snorkelling. The spa is amazing and the food at all of the restaurants is first class. The thing that makes it all special are the wonderful, friendly people that look after your every need. They have a great sense of humour and nothing is ever too much trouble. We'll be back again next year. "
It is really hard to write about it .It is just magic .We had a beach Villa und going out in the morning and having a swim is great .You only hear the birds and the sea and you only see the sky and the ocean .The resort at its self feels like as it had been grown with the island .Staff an restaurants are reflecting the beauty of the Island .
"We stayed at Six Senses for five days, and it was more than we could've ever dreamed of. I don't have a single negative thing to say about it. Sato was our GEM and he is truly a gem! Everything was perfect from the food, to the views, to the activities. The room was flawless. I loved being barefoot the entire time - it was so freeing! It was an absolute pleasure to stay there and I can't wait to go back.  **Tip on Tipping: I think you are expected to tip throughout your time there. We didn't realize that, and were scrambling at the end trying to remember who helped us and distribute money. We were on cloud 9 and  totally forgot about it, so just a little recommendation :)"
"Door to door, our journey from London was 23 hours, but even arriving in the dark we could tell it was worth it.  From the moment you arrive at Male you are guided by Six Senses staff.  When we stepped onto the speed boat that took us from Kahadoo to the resort, we placed our shoes in a cloth bag and thats where they stayed for the whole holiday...bliss!  We were greeted by the General Manager and our GEM Shinan, then taken by buggy to our beach villas (one for us, one for our daughters). Quick shower in the outdoor shower then off to Longitude for dinner and a much needed beer!  There are so many positive things to say about our stay here, but I will try to summarise! Loved the villas, loved being upgraded after 3 nights to a family villa with pool and next door beach villa,‚Ä¶"
"I'm not sure 2000 characters is enough to explain just how incredible this place is!   From the moment my wide and I arrived on the island via speedboat we were treated like royalty.. We arrived late at night, much later than we were due to, but the staff had insured that we still had food and drink ready for us, and made us feel instantly welcome. The staff all have the fabulous knack of being there when you need them, without pestering you like some hotels/resorts can do.   A beautiful setting, plenty to do, and friendly people (we loved how literally every single person, staff or fellow guests would say 'hello' or 'good morning' to each  other). We stayed in a water villa and it was immaculate, regularly cleaned, and always stocked with whatever we needed. Our GEM (Guest‚Ä¶"
"This is our third time at Laamu and it just gets better and it was pretty amazing the first time! We stayed in the most incredible beach bungalow with our own pool. The facilities are amazing and the island just beautiful. However, all this aside it is the staff and the incredible service that just make this place truly magical. I can not recommend it highly enough! Best holiday ever!"
This is the most perfect resort. It has a very eco-friendly philosophy which we loved. It feels very trendy. We visited on our honeymoon in September of this year.  We had our own personalised bikes to travel around the island on. There are lots of different resteraunts- all serving excellent quality food. There is a free ice-cream parlour which serves lots of different flavours daily. The snorkelling trip is incredible- we saw turtles and black reef tip sharks as well as many other amazing things. The rooms are beautiful- we stayed on Jetty C (the furthers away from the fascilities- but very private and still only a 3 min cycle ride away. Arif looked after us during our honeymoon and he was just amazing. Everything we wanted our honeymoon to be. The staff went above and beyond.
"First of all, if you need to go away from everything.... this is the place. After you arrive in Male you have a one hour flight and then a 20 minutes speed boat trip until you arrive to this beautiful oasis. Fabulous and friendly staff, always willing to help and make your experience a great one. We stayed in one of the private and secluded bungalows on the beach.  I highly recommend this place, you have your own pool (which is surprisingly bigger than what we expected), a fantastic wooden deck, comfortable couches, and a private path to your own private piece of beach, where your chairs and shade will be always ready for you. If you go with your kids they have a smaller room close to the main room and they will have a private bathroom and lots of fun! Highly recommend this‚Ä¶"
"My fianc√© and I wanted to do something amazing for our honeymoon. We knew we wanted to go to Maldives. Six Senses was recommended to us by our travel agent and boy did they deliver! Everything from start to finish was beyond perfect. Our GEM was amazing and made our experience that much more perfect. Although we cannot control the weather, we made the most out of our days at the spa and gym. If you want to experience paradise, go here. It will be an unforgettable experience. From the food to the service, there are no greater words. "
"What's Excellent..  1) Absolutely Amazing room. From the bed, the outdoor shower, the sun beds, the rooftop, everything is top notch without a single flaw.   2) (some) Great hospitality: Because of the domestic flight scheduling, we had to spend 5 hours in Male airport for our return flight. Upon hearing our complains, the manager arranged for us to have a comfortable buffet breakfast at a Hotel just right by the Male Airport.   What's Average.. 1) Service Staff: It could be just us, but I don't really find the staff to be that fantastic as others described. Could be me being picky here. Yes, they all speak perfect English, and were generally nice people. There were some usual happy staffs, but some of them were more quiet and reserved.   2) Accessibility : Cycling around the‚Ä¶"
"The Maldives in 2015 was not originally the plan for our main holiday, however I am incredibly glad that we experienced this fantastic place. I am convinced that our visit would not have been nearly as memorable if we had stayed at any other hotel. The Six Senses for me absolutely embodies what the Maldives is about.  This is understated beach chic luxury at its best. The water villa we were assigned was on jetty A, and I would recommend this as it is close to every single amenity on the island. Not that getting around was a problem, given that you are provided with bicycles to explore with.   The good: the villa. Just the right amount of features. Great sound system which had separate controls in the open air bathroom. We spent a lot of time in there as the shower and bath were‚Ä¶"
"Everything that the other reviews say are absolutely spot on - the professional and genuinely friendly staff, seamless transfer to and from the island resort from Male airport, the incredible infrastructure that provides a luxury experience in paradise, the impressive culinary standards and of course the ice-cream bar. We were really pleased that we booked a few weeks there because there's plenty to do on and off the island, plus an impressive variety of dining options. We are also very impressed with the general philosophy behind Sixth Senses resorts (we've visited a few). It is a sustainable, holistic and organic experience (not at all like a yoga/health camp that only serves raw food and prohibits alcohol) but you can be as decadent or as active as you want.

"Love the 360 degree ocean view bungalows, love the crystal clear water and the white & soft beach, love the food (incl. free ice-cream every day starting 2pm), love snorkelling in the house reef ...... Wish to go back in the near future!"
"Been here for my honeymoon and it was simply perfect from start to end. When we arrived at Male airport, we were welcomed by one hotel representative who guided us to our plane to Kadhoo (a closer island) where we took a speedboat to Six Senses - process was smooth and painless. The hotel structure, staff and location (atoll, corals, etc) are simply amazing. Every single staff speak good english. This is a top notch hotel definitely. Food-wise they offer excellent options - Sip Sip (chill, beach, pool), Zen (japanese dinner), Leaf (organic dinner), Main Restaurant, Chill Bar (snorkel). Our GEM Yasir deserves huge props as he was outstanding, helpful and always concerned with our needs. Managed to take us in a last minute boat trip to search for dolphins - and we found them!‚Ä¶"
"Everything is perfect for this hotel. We had a water villa with great ocean view and private pool, can just jump off the bed then jump again into the sea directly. There is various selection of restaurants, and the view of the main dining area is marvelous, it has tables and seats extended directly into the sea, and i actually saw two mantas while i was having breakfasts one day. The SPA is also very nice, it is a private villa with open air flow. The SPA therapist is very professional and she recommaned me a treatment which fit my body condition very well. Last but not least, I want to say special thanks to my GEM Fayaz, during our stays in Six Senses, he was taking very good care with us and been there for us like 24/7. I had greatest time with him during snorkeling and he is‚Ä¶"
"We stayed for 1 week in late September. It‚Äôs a lovely tropical paradise island with friendly staff, great service and lots of activities to try. You have to take a 20 min domestic flight to get here, but it‚Äôs worth the extra time. There are many restaurants to choose from. Our favorite is Leaf ‚Äì with its open kitchen and a different set-menu every day. It was a joy to watch the chefs at work creating edible art. And the wine-dinner in Altitude was wonderful, with the sommelier talking and teaching us about different wines. Chill bar has great vietnamese food and easy access to the house reef. And of course the delicious free homemade ice cream. Our friendly and helpful GEM Ravah took great care of us."
"This was my second stay in Maldives , this time it was little bit difficult to get to this hotel . After you arrived at international airport , you need transfer to domestic terminal and wait for domestic connection , and fly approximately for one hour and then continue with boat for another half of hour , but worth it because then you are finally in paradise !  After arrived to the hotel we were welcomed with policy of barefoot , which were from beginning little bit strange but after while we felt independent and free and we also got own bikes with personalized ""license plate number"" , which we used for transporting around the island .  Room was perfect , we had over water villa with own pool . Villa look like it will be cut it from Robinson Crusoe diary . Best were mornings ,‚Ä¶"
"We stayed at this six senses for 10 days because we were worried there wasn't much to do and with kids that they woyld get bored but that was completely not the case. We could have stayed there for months and were shattered when we had to leave our paradise away from home. From the service from the GEM's(ours was Ravah. He was good), the friendly and efficient food and beverage staff(especially Nail at longtitude restaurant), the Managers(Mina couldnt do enough to help) or just the overall atmosphere felt  was flawless. We enjoyed the water sports. (Kayaking, paddle boarding, diving)  and most of all snorkeling the house reef among sharks (not dangerous),mooray eels, turtles and rays as well as the beatiful coral reef it was spectacular.

The best place on earth So friendly people Excellent service Beatiful villa Proffesionel diver shop Delicious foot at the restaurants Excellent vine  Best staff ever Beautiful view at the ocean Snorkeling tours 
"A hotel with the best ammenities can also be environmentally friendly and almost sustainable on its own. This is something we learned at Six Sense Laamu, where we were pleaseantly surprised to not see any plastic container during our whole stay. That is just an example, but we found commendable that, while having the best guest care and all we could hope for during our honeymoon, everything provided to us was very naturally part of the surroundings and environtment of the island.  The hotel provides many entertainment options and great restaurants.  We would go back in the blink of an eye!"
"In may 2015 we went to Six Senses Lamuu for our honeymoon, which was like a dream. We had the best days of our life's, excellent place joined with lovely people and excellent food, what else could we wish for. Every single person was very friendly at the island, we felt like we were in a movie scene. We came back with lovely memories and we were definitely coming back. It didn't take us long, and in September 2015 we came back to Six Senses this time with another couple. We were welcomed like the first time, each staff (hard to call them staff they are all like a family member) made us feel more then welcome. Both times we stayed at a water villa, first time it was an ocean water villa, the second time it was a logoon water villa. They are both more than amazing, the sea is‚Ä¶"
"I have been in 12 resorts in the Maldives (some of them top-knotch 5* resorts like Baros, Halaveli, Gili Lankafushi, Shagri-La, Taj...) and I can say without doubt that Six Senses Laamu is the best resort in the Maldives for the following reasons:  1. Remoteness & privacy: Six Senses Laamu is the only resort in Laamu atoll (a remote atoll in southern Maldives). We really felt like we were on a desert island as we barely saw  boats or planes around. In other resorts in frequented atolls like Ari or Male, we saw planes and boats passing all day long.   2. Island size/villas/privacy: Island is HUGE compared to other islands in the Maldives. There are a high numbers of villas, but since the island is so big, we felt alone in the island. Privacy at its best. Having almost all the‚Ä¶"
"Wow, the best vacation ever !!!  The resort is perfect,dreamy, service and rooms are more than superb.... really no need to add anything else , this is a must and should be the resort when visiting the Maldives.       "
"Our stay at Six Senses Laamu was an unforgettable one. Everything from the food, friendly professional staff, and accommodation to the spectacular diving and snorkelling were simply outstanding. We loved the luxurious but down-to-earth philosophy of not needing shoes, and the commitment to eco values without compromising on comfort, attention to detail and superb quality. A special mention goes to the dive team who showed us a fantastic time - we saw mantas, sharks, turtles, big schools of fish and beautiful coral and we were always the only ones at the dive site - what a treat! The unlimited free ice-cream with an incredible variety of flavours was also a favourite feature. The natural setting for the resort is also stunning, with blindingly white deserted beaches, turquoise‚Ä¶"
"While there a many great ocean experiences to choose from, those that separate themselves from the the rest are those who along with great service standards take it upon themselves to welcome the world with eco friendly expertise. We had a behind the scenes tour and discovered efficiencies well beyond the expected. From the water desalination operation which ensure the delivery of fresh drinking water for every guest (water bottles are changed every 8 hours without exception) to the power plant that makes this far away place run, all at Six Senses make sure that your experience will be second to none. Our experience with places that offer personal butlers or as Six Senses calls them GEMS (guest experience managers) is well established and while others have been very good, the‚Ä¶"
"We brought my immediate family to the Maldives and it was their first time. It was a bit of a trek (30 mins domestic flight and 20 mins speedboat) to get there but worth the trip.  Our Favourite part of the Six Senses was their food (best in a 5 star resort that we've been to) - unpretentious, appetising and fresh! Other memorable parts was their awesome house reef (so nearby the restaurants you can just jump in from the ladders) and free ice cream bar.  I really wanted to try our surfing but found the staff at the surfing school somewhat unfriendly so that put me off completely doing any activities there. What a shame though - this was a blemish in what was an otherwise great trip.  Our GEM was really helpful, especially with my older parents who went snorkelling. The over‚Ä¶"
"Just got home from our 10th wedding anniversary! A lovely place for honymooners and wedding celebrations! Great food, very nice villas, beaches, house-reaf, pool, cinema under the stars, free ice-cream. We loved their ECO thinking in food and environment, and the bicycles provided for all guests. Even if we where there in rain season (September) the weather was great. 11 days only 2 with rain.  Drinks and food is very expensive. That is the only down part.  The staff where so nice, friendly and helpful.   We absolutely recommend this place!"
"An amazing experience, great pool area with bar, several restaurants with fine food. Very organised team, ready to make you happy at any moment. Well designed gym area, for the once willing to be in fit during the holidays. Outdoor cinema, bicycles and gardening available."
"I recommend this place for all couples, honeymooners, even friends who are looking for some place magical, beautiful and relaxing.  The week I spent in Six Senses Laamu with my Husband was completely an unforgettable experience. Full of excitement and rich in body, mind and spirit relaxation. Id give 10 out of 10 for the service as well. Staff members make you feel like you are home, their smile and friendly attitude makes you feel like we are all family, leaving was sad. I will try my best in future to visit again because I also miss the friends we made at Six Senses, everyone is so lovely. Im absolutely delighted and thankful for choosing Six Senses Laamu for our honeymoon."
"We came here on 5th Sep. to celebrate our honeymoon. It offers a variety of experience to enjoy like Spa, Snorkeling, even watching the sunrise and the sunset on the beach. Our room, Laaum water villa No.15, facing the Indian Ocean, has a very good view, quiet and relaxing. All the staff, especially our GEM, AFrale(Sorry for can't spelling correctly) and the kind man who cleaning our villa everyday during our stay, are pretty nice and friendly. We enjoy the blue pure ocean water, enjoy the delicious food in the main restaurant, and enjoy the harmonious atmosphere of Six Senses Laaum. All these become an unforgetable experience of my husband and I. I believe we will come back again in the near future and truly recommend Laaum to our friends. BTW, we really like the wooden sea‚Ä¶"
"""Best resort ever""  my husband and son announced half way through our stay and I had to agree.  We loved everything about Six Senses Laamu.  The accommodations surpassed our expectations - we loved the room and how it flowed between inside and out as well as all the different seating areas outside and on the deck above.  The feel was so much better and more luxurious (in a very low key way) than I expected from the pictures.  They were filled with everything you could need including after son lotion and they always managed to clean the rooms when we were out at breakfast so that housecleaning was never intrusive as it can be at other places.  We stayed on Jetty A in overwater villas which were very private and well spaced - compared to some other resorts where unless you take‚Ä¶"
"Possibly planet earths most amazing 5* island resort. We were there for a week on honeymoon and its highly recommended. We stayed in a water Villa which was just idyllic. Being able to dive in the most beautiful clear blue water straight from your villa and snorkel around with Turtles, rays, nemos etc was simply unforgettable. The staff were extremely professional and very helpful across the board. We had a back of house tour which highlighted the efforts of Six Senses sustainable ethos. Yes the drinks and some excursions are expensive as the all inclusive package does not cover drinks. We would recommend half board and have a big breakfast and supper.  The ice cream parlor is open all day and is complimentary so you can spoil yourself with this. No need to pack loads of shoes‚Ä¶"
"Perfection! This place is paradise. Our third trip to the Maldives and this was our favourite so far. Aside for the beautiful water villas (decor and layout was well thought out and appealing to anyone's tastes), the meals were delicious, the activities offered were plentiful, and the staff went above and beyond.  You have a private GEM (butler) who you can call at any time to resolve any issues(not that there were any) or if you needed something.  Our GEM was Sindhaan and he would book us in at the restaurants, meet us at breakfast and find out how we were doing, if there was anything else he could help with.  Just amazing!  The managers were so hands on and always around! Frans really stood out as being the most helpful and so down to earth and accommodating.   Ocean‚Ä¶"
"The Maldives is one of those places you see online, in brochures and it looks so beautiful. Then, you arrive and it blows your mind a thousand times over due to it's impossible over the top beauty. This resort is one of those. We travel quite a lot yet this resort setting literally took my breath away (giddy with excitement type feelings).   Whilst there are so many resorts you can book in the Maldives, at the top end there's a handful and we are so glad that we chose Six Senses - it really was an incredible experience and stay and (in my opinion) worth every dollar paid. We were lucky enough to book a package which included breakfast, massages, a cruise and a daily USD dining credit. Don‚Äôt expect the daily credit to cover lunch / dinner yet it certainly helped.

"This hotel is not just a hotel - it is an experience. It's living in paradise.  ACCOMODATION (Regarding water villas only) There are 3 Jetty's - A, B, C. They are all very far from each other. The middle or end of A is definitely the prime location because it is close to all the hotel's amenities while still being private. There are about 3-4 villas on Jetty A that the restaurants look straight into... don't get stuck in one of those! It's also definitely worth paying for an upgrade to one of the Ocean Villas, which have amazing snorkelling right off your deck.  The accommodation is ridiculously, insanely, amazing. You aren't going to be disappointed :)  WEATHER We went at the beginning of September which is low season. We had 2 days that were cloudy/very rainy, 2 that were‚Ä¶"
"Great hotel. Would recommend to anyone that can get there. Particularly impressed with the villas, food, access to water sports and the kindness and helpfulness of the staff. Ravah on the GEM team and David who runs the surfing were particularly great."
"My wife and I stayed in Six Senses Laamu Island for our fifth anniversary and it was a wonderful experience. There are really only positive things to say.  The Island is located in the Laamu Atol and is great for swimming & snorkeling.  Temperature ranges from 27-34 degrees Celsius so its always warm and you will always wear shorts & t-shirt. In the week we spent (beginning August) there were a few violent rain storms but otherwise very sunny.  You can see most species of regional tropical fish in the House Reef and we even saw two types of sea turtle, as well as two types of stingray in the lagoon around our villa. On our last day, a school of dolphins swam by as we ate breakfast.  The food was wonderfully presented with ingredients growth organically on the island in some‚Ä¶"
"Good concept, different from other resorts in Maldives. Usually all the facilities are scattered around the island, while this one has everything condensend, living more space for beaches and privacy. Amazing water villa. Good wine and cold cuts selections (which is unusual in Maldives). The highlight is the complimentary icecream counter, excellent and fantastic idea. Will come back for sure."
A lovely place full of possibilities. The kindness of the service is one of their strong points. Don't forget to explore their restaurants. Its quality is amazing. Very appropiate to have a wonderful honeymoon!
"By far the best hotel experience we ever had. Place is amazing, food is great and the staff will do about anything for the the guest to have the best experience possible. All details are well thought and organized so you forget the world while you are there. Specially our GEM (guest experience maker) Inas was amazing. Truly live up for his role. Would definitely recommend this place!"
This is not our first time in the Maldives. We have also visited the Shangri-la which I also rated 5 stars...but Six Senses is a different 5 stars. Let me explain. The Shang is spectacular...very beautifully detailed and high class (and it has a 9 hole 3par golf course...big points for that) Like all Shangs one has the feeling of a superior hotel but in the middle of the ocean. No complaints whatsoever. If you're looking for classy choose the Shang. Now Six Senses is different because it has what I'd call 'relaxed luxury'. Before you even come they say leave your shoes at home and it's true. I didn't even wear flip-flops once in 8 days. They also tell you leave your plastic cosmetics and shower amenities at home too...they provide everything (in biodegradable form) in refillable‚Ä¶
"Once we get to the resort after a 15 minutes speeboat trip from Khadhoo aiport, we realized that it would be the better experience ever!!! I haven't words enough to thank everyone above all Ravah, our GEM, Jawa, always giving us the most sweetful smile and treat everytime we met, and Alex from the dive center, who had the patience to teach in what was our first experience under the water. This excellent staff together with one of the dreamest places I've ever seen, makes us want to repeat next time we travel to Maldives                            "
From the arrival in Male to the departure we felt very wrk taken care off. This is an amazing resort and we really liked he private butler concept for each villa.   The food in the restaurants were amazing. Be sure to try the tuna and lobster - just mind blowing :-)
We stayed at the Six Senses Laamu for 5 nights during out Honeymoon. It was an extraordinary experience. Right when you step on the boat to go to the Hotel you just feel like you are in Paradise. Water is amazing the hotel amenities are beautfiful and all the food was incredibly good... The Hotel staff is always there to help you and make you feel special. We loved how much they respect the environment and all the eco-friendly initiatives. We would definitely recommend this hotel specially if you like nature and relaxation.       
Great resort with staff to match. Smiling faces everywhere. Service people who simply cannot do enough for guests. The Maldives create a beautiful backdrop for this superb resort. Free ice cream parlour brilliant.                            
"Well worth the long flight flights and connecting speed boat, this is the place if you want to relax in amazing comfort and style.  The sea is truly beautiful and crystal clear.  Staff are attentive and willing to please.  The head chef Martin has a well oiled team whirring away to produce the best quality food.  The beach cinema was glorious and Adam at Sip Sip - the beach restaurant and bar will probably end up running the place in a few years.  We stayed for 10 days, rode our bikes, went barefoot the whole time, experienced the best snorkeling by far ( turtles, manta-rays, reef sharks, and oh so many fish in so many colours), went night fishing, enjoyed the manicures, pedicures and massages....just the best.  The service is excellent but the desire to up-sell was a bit‚Ä¶"
"We spent 4 nights at Villa 19 which is Laamu Water Villa with Pool at the end of Jetty A. The villa is amazing in terms of design, space, and function. The pool is of good size in which we can really swim. Each villa is located far from other villas enough to feel privacy. Our villa is facing Jetty B. However, during our stay, I believe Jetty B was closed for maintenance, so there was no other guests in our sight when we were around our deck area.  During our stay, we tried Longitude (breakfast & dinner), Zen (dinner), Sip Sip (lunch), and Leaf (dinner). We both agree that Leaf is the most impressive one.  I also tried the spa, and it is wonderful experience for its massage, the beautiful spa rooms and the relaxing juice bar.  Also there are large selection of activities offered‚Ä¶"
"Just spent 7 days in Laamu with my husband and 10 year old daughter and we loved it. Everything was seamlessly executed. That's service! We have been to many Six Senses resorts like Yao Noi, Con Dao, Samui and Soneva Kiri but this is our favourite so far. "
"Loved: The design - hammock over the ocean, sunken dining table on the balcony, loungers on the balcony, see through panel in the toilet. The acitivities - Dolphin cruise (did not manage to see any, but they arranged for another trip for us the next day without additional charges). Spa was incredible. Most relaxing, enjoyable experience EVER. The massage bed was perfect, the fans overhead cooled us down without being noisy, the sound of the waves... The entire experience of entering the spa, walking through the foliage into this hidden retreat was unforgettable.  The service - both the GEM and the housekeeper were amazing, I had a small but nasty wound and requested for plasters, it was replenished daily so I could change the plasters everyday. Our GEM met us when we took a‚Ä¶"
I stayed at this resort for my honeymoon in 2013.  The atmosphere was so peaceful and romantic and beautiful. Sunsets were stunning and breathtaking.  We could see thousands of stars at night. Definitely want to stay there again. The food was amazing and they do beach parties once a week and also do movie screenings in the jungle at night.  Absolutely amazing..!
"We were on honeymoon and the season we went was perfect. Only one rainy day and it lasted a few hours. When we left the hotel, i recall telling my wife, ""i can't find even one thing to complain about this resort"". Everyone tries to make you happy. The island's habitat is astonishing, no wild life. I thought myself in the LOST series island. We stayed 3 days in Ocean Beach Villa with pool and 2 days in Water Villa with pool. The pool is big enough to swim. We liked the beach villa more because of it's privacy (villa no:91). The villas, the island, the food everything was perfect. You don't need to think about another alternative if you want to go to the Maldives. If we go to Maldives again, it will definetly be Six Senses Laamu not to dissapoint ourselves. Thanks for everyone‚Ä¶"
"After we got off from the plane in Male airport. We were greeted with warmth by a six senses staff. Then we have to take another flight and speed boat before we arrive at the hotel. The rooms were very clean, comfortable with open shower place and a big deck that allow you to be very close to the oceans. The is just right in front of us. We can just jump out of our deck and start to snorkle. We saw turtles swimming by our room. sharks, all kinds of beautiful fishes, corals and dolphins. The hotel emphasize on sustainability and try to protect the environment. No plastic bottles. All the water supply in the rooms are in glass bottles. There are 5 restaurants and beach dinners which provide varieties for your stay. They even have free ice cream from 12:30pm to 10 pm which is a‚Ä¶"
We spent a week in Laamu few days ago and I still can't get over how spectacular it was. The rooms are superior quality compared to other resorts in Maldives. Food is amazing. Every restaurant staff knew I was allergic to Gluten and remembered at every meal. We used the spa extensively and the massage is one of the best I have had in my whole life. Don't think - Just go to Laamu!!!!

"We just had our honeymoon and stayed 10 days.  The resort is very wild and beautiful, not as stylish as some of the hotels I prefer, more of a Relais Chateaux type vibe of chill, outdoorsy and comfortable surroundings with high quality and few people, very exclusive. We got lucky with the weather although in July y have to expect a solid 1-2 hours daily of heavy rain. It¬¥s rather refreshing though, did not bother us much.  We picked a villa with pool and on a semi-private beach. As you walk the beach there are two lounges per house and about 7 houses on the beach plus the common swimming pool.

From the reservation team, GEM, and all the staffs of Six Senses Laamu, thank you very much for your hospitality, especially our GEM, Ravah, a perfect-10 service !! Staying at Water Villa with private pool (upgrading due to some adjustment), very privacy, it's a bit far from the main restaurant, but my family won't feel tired and enjoy cycling on the island. Food are excellent, especially The Leaf Restaurant, and the pizza at Sip Sip Bar, my children love it so much. Will come back here again !!"

I really appreciate our GEM, Afra, and the resort staff who are always attentive with a smile.  The quality of F&B is simply superb..!

Exceptional experience - can only highly recommend: All staff (without exceptions) are super friendly and polite! The overall hospitality is state of art. Kids loved it (baby and 4-year old).

Although we were there during the low season, we had a good weather during our stay (except for one cloudy day).  The snorkeling is an absolute must. The corals are spectacular, and the marine life is what can be expected in the Maldives: rays, turtles, fish of all colours and sizes.

Our GEM, Arif,  was a sweetheart, and all the people on the island always met us with a smile.  The island is so clean and I bow down for the women and men that each morning clean up the beach for leaves and rocks!!

Prior to booking the trip I did months of extensive research on all the best hotels in the Maldives and we decided to book Six Senses Laamu for the following reasons: 1) it has an over water reef; 2) the lagoon villas are spacious and have a large outdoor deck with hammocks; 3) we could book full board meal plan which didn't restrict us to eating in the same restaurant every night and suffering nightly buffets; 4) the complimentary ice cream bar; 5)  a la carte option at breakfast.   Having just returned I can beyond a doubt say this is the best resort I have ever experienced and I could not recommend it more to any couples or honeymooners. Firstly the resort is‚Ä¶
"My stay at Six Senses Laamu would have to be the most beautiful, perfect Island experience I have had in my life. It was perfect in every way, the high light would be spending the days snorkelling in the reefs for hours on end then swimming up to the bar for champagne then back to the most beautiful waters and reefs in the world and repeat!! :) ."
"The domestic flights to Laamu leave in the morning to lunchtime so that whether you stay overnight in Male or get a quick connection depends upon when your international flight arrives. Staying overnight is not a problem as Traders Hotel is excellent and Six Senses Staff look after all arrangements well. The domestic flight is smooth although you should try to get a direct flight as some visit other places first. Same for the return, check if your flight goes direct to Male or stops on the way. The domestic flight non stop is less than an hour and the boat ride in a luxury cruiser lasts about 20 minutes. The Six Senses Resort is the only one in Laamu Atoll which is huge so there is no competition for dive or snorkelling sites. But the house reef snorkelling is brilliant - 200‚Ä¶"
"Expensive but worth every penny.  Service is second to none.  If you like relaxing, diving, surfing, and great food in one of the most beautiful places in the world this place is for you.  Thank you to all of the staff!!!"
"I meant to write a review but a year late! We had such an amazing experience with my husband and daughter that I just promised myself I should. The facilities, the staff, the food, the kids club. Not much to fault. Our arrival there was rather rocky as the plane to the island was severely delayed so I was in such a bad mood and nothing could pull me back. I was wrong. They were absolutely fantastic from the moment we stepped onto the Island.Would I go back?  In a heartbeat!"
"This resort is amazing. No words can describe it. Not only the property but the hospitality of this resort is just amazing. The staff including the chef, the buggy driver, the librarian, the diver, the room service staff all of them were just amazing. They always greeted us with smile and were always happy to help. The view that you get right from your bed when you wake up in the morning is out of the world. You can just go for a swim in the right from your villa. The snorkelling experience was amazing. The Indian chef used to asked us what we want for the breakfast or dinner (since we were vegetarian and jain) and they used to serve us. Inaaz and Amade were two real good people who made our stay very comfortable. Thanks guys. Amazing place. I went with my cousins. Its not only‚Ä¶"
"A never Ending story about Six senses laamu resort. from the airport representative to the boat crew and the resort staff specially the management. it's unforgettable experience i only had short trip in that place but it's really mark in my heart and my mind. i was wondering why do i need to take off my shoes and put it in a nice bag, then i just realize that i need to forget and set aside for a while all my stress and and work and other things in my mind on that day because that place will give me a good holiday. at the boat on our way to the resort it was an awesome warm welcome from the dolphins a dozen of dolphins jumping and going around the boat it's really feel good and i step down to the Jetty a warm welcome from the GM and the other staff. I stay in Ocean Water Villa‚Ä¶"
"This place is fabulous. Our GEM, Inaz, was fun, friendly, and helpful. The staff is spectacular: Yoosuf, Lynn, Heidi (spa), Chem (spa), Mao, Nape, Muhaimin, Shanta (bartender), Habib, and Sindhaan. Six Senses is spectacular because it has a spectacular staff.  The rooms are stunning. The music in the room is so relaxing. I had to buy the CD.  My friend and I spent our 40th birthdays here. This place is romantic but just as great for friends/family. We were two young women (college friends, one from NY and one from LA) who wanted to relax, enjoy the water sports, and get pampered at the spa. It's a quiet resort. The spa is wonderful. Take a yoga/meditation class.  Enjoy the drinks, pizza, and salads at Sip Sip.  Chill Bar had great Vietnamese food.  Longitude: We loved loved‚Ä¶"
"We researched a lot of resorts in the Maldives and ended up choosing Six Senses Laamu. We definitely made the right decision. Most reviews talk about the details of the place, so I'll just review a few other points  - Food - I'm vegetarian, and the menus had a variety of options. We met one of the Chefs one night and he said they would also make things to order if I wanted. The food was fresh, excellent and flavourful. We paid extra for the Chilli Table dinner, which was amazing and well worth it for the outdoor experience (bats swooping over our heads!) The only night we didn't like was the Asian night, as the Indian food was a bit bland for our taste (we eat a lot of spice). If you're a dessert person, this is the place to be - everything was incredible and so beautifully‚Ä¶"
"Let me begin this review by saying I've been to the Maldives multiple times. I know what to expect from the exotic location, especially for the price you pay to get there.  I expected a lot from the Six Senses, Laamu. The disappointment was so great that I feel cheated from a vacation that was supposed to be incredible.  First, let's talk about the Spa. The hotel chain is known for this. In fact, when booking our trip this was actually something that played a role in our decision. What a major letdown. It is mind boggling to me why the architects didn't design the spa in a way where you could enjoy the beautiful ocean that you fly so far to see. Instead, all spa rooms are isolated in small bungalow like quarters and the facility itself wasn't at all what I expected. That being‚Ä¶"
i love this resort ! it's perfect for diving as the water is very clear ~everything is so good and the staffs are friendly and they sre always smiling and kids friendly! However I am not satisfied with a staff name Yuri ~ she is so not friendly to the Chinese guests despite the fact that she speaks chinese ~  she never smiles when talking to us and the way she talked to us is not polite ~ so this is the only negative comments in this resort.
"WOW!!  What a place!!  We felt like royalty for 10 days.  My husband decided to surprise me and take me to an unknown destination for our honeymoon, I had no idea it was going to be as wonderful as it was! It was like paradise, we were upgraded on arrival to an ocean villa, and it oozed luxury from the well air conditioned rooms to the bath overlooking the ocean and the outdoor shower.  Everything about the place was just magical. We were met by our butler on arrival who was welcoming and helpful (sometimes overly so!) we were shown around the resort and to our villa.  We were given bikes to make our way around the island which was so fun! There's lots of extra's you can sign up for, massages, excursions, wine tasting...we didn't do much as the prices were so expensive, which‚Ä¶"
"This was our third visit to the Maldives. It was meant to be our anniversary trip as we had honeymooned at the W Maldives in 2007. We also have been to Gili Langfushi. Coming out of a death in the family and quite a stressful time I wanted this trip to be very special, and it turned out anything but that. Don't get me wrong the resort is beautiful, although a bit overbuilt as far as structures over water, but it's beautiful especially if this is your first experience in the Maldives.  We decided on this resort as our travel organizer recommended this hotel and told us that he had a very special relationship. We thought that this relationship would bring that special touch and we had heard so much about Six Senses and it's reputation for top notch service. As they say,‚Ä¶"
"I went there recently for my honeymoon and it was the best experience I have ever had.   Staffs were very friendly and very helpful in every way. Always smiling and greeting you all the time.  Got my villa upgraded and many benefits given because of the honeymoon. So to all honeymooners, please let the resort know that you are having your honeymoon there. (you will have to provide some kind of proof for this one)  Food was great. The room was amazing and the services given were top class.  For those thinking of going here, please budget yourself USD100 per person per day if you want to enjoy their activities and food. (They also have complimentary activities. They will let you know once you arrive)  Will definitely come back here again."
"After a scenic flight from Male we arrived in a small local airport and were taken by speedboat to the resort. A warm welcome was waiting at the dock and we arrived in paradise. We had a beach villa with a private pool and it was very private directly on the beach. (Do not book a beach villa on the lagoon side ‚Äì the beach is not very nice on that side). A short walk along the beach to the new (and very nice) pool area and further on to the restaurant area. If you do not want to walk, you can use the bike which is provided for every villa. Everything worked perfect ‚Äì the welcome, check-in, the huge villa, our GEM, restaurants and bars. The snorkelling is very good, just a few meters from the Chill Bar with a nice sun deck.

"We spent eight nights at Six Senses, Laamu on our honeymoon and had a fantastic time.  The resort location is stunning with beautiful crystal clear waters accessible from our overwater bungalow.  The service we received was faultless, both from our GEM (guest experience maker) Mr Sato, and from all other resort staff.  We chose Six Senses for our honeymoon because we wanted to surf and managed to get loads of great waves in spite of some uncooperative weather on a few days.  Dave (the resort surf instructor) and Maud (the local guide) both did a great job of looking after us and making sure we could maximise our time in the water.  The day trip to ""Machines"" was a fantastic opportunity to venture further afield to see some of the other islands and breaks in the atoll, and we‚Ä¶"
"This was by far the best holiday we ever had !! (And we do travel a lot) The island is beautiful, the crystal water is just amazing and the water villa was very comfortable and private. We loved the bike rides around the island :) and the Under the Stars Cinema is a awesome idea, very romantic way of finish off the night!! We were well looked after by our GM Abdullah, he did a great job and we hope to have him as our GM again on our next visit. The food was very good, with plates and flavours to please all tastes. I have to take my Hat off to the Jetty C house keeping staff, they did a ""fantastic job""  looking after us and our Villa!!  Congratulations to all Six Senses staff!! They were always there to help you and everyone was super friendly, well informed and social making our‚Ä¶"
"We stayed here for 10 wonderful nights. The location, the accommodation, the staff, the food, the activities all first class. If you want an idyllic island holiday stay here. We had an over water villa and woke looking at an aqua sea with surf on the horizon. A swim off our deck then on our push bikes to the excellent breakfast with no end of choices. Perhaps a gym session then snorkelling on the house reef. Lunch by the beautiful pool. Beach, ice cream freshly made on site and complimentary! Cocktails watching the sun go down. Such lovely, mainly local, staff make your stay perfect. Your GEM will organise all your needs, even waking us at 5.30 am and escorting us to a hatching turtle nest! I can't recommend this place highly enough. Can't wait to go back."
I'm not a great contributor in the reviews section of Tripadvisor.  But this time I'm going to spend a part of the honeymoon in Six Senses Laamu and must say few words. The reservation process went just fine. But after that in the process discussing some special details I found it difficult to have a conversation with the employee named Rittey (Rifshaz Ibrahim). The emails are being replied with the few days delay. And all responses come with the standard phrases and information that can be easily found on the website (instead of specific answers to the specific questions). I still believe that the hotel with such great reviews couldn't have all that unattentive and incompetent staff even in the reservation department. And I still hope this will be an incredible experience like‚Ä¶
"Beginning with the boat ride from the airport where they gave us bags to put our shoes in (you remain barefoot the entire stay) and fresh lemonade, this vacation was phenomenal!! Our two bedroom villa on the beach was gorgeous and came with the Butler who took wonderful care of us. We had bicycles parked outside the Villa with our initials carved on the back.  The outdoor showers were my favorite part. Oh and the infinity pool!  There was so much to do every day, beginning with a crack of dawn walk on the beach to watch the sunrise and baby sharks swimming in the surf.  Followed by a Nespresso cappuccino on my lounge chair on the beach in my robe.  We enjoyed the buffet breakfast far too much,  as well as  the restaurant location perched on the edge of the Indian Ocean  and the‚Ä¶"
"The experience at this resort exceeds my expectations. We were greeted by the GM and staff on arrival and departure. The staff were easy to talk with and discuss and were always helpful.When we arrived at the airport in Male all the travel arrangements were efficiently arranged without a hiccup. The staff services were courteous and prompt and were very helpful. They also took the initiative without prompting-for example when the floor was wet, they wiped it dry without asking promptly.The place is immaculately clean. The concept of conservation is emphasised by the resort. Disposable cans/glass/plastic/paper drop-ins are available tag every chalet jetty. Restaurant food is of the highest quality-local/Vietnamese/Continental-food is fresh and organic. They have their own‚Ä¶"
"We stayed at six sense for five days. From arrival at airport to check in for domestics flight, it was five star service all the way.  The rooms were beautiful, the water was stunning and everything was simply magical. The sand bank is a must! Can't wait to visit again "
Perfect and quiet location and perfect Villas. The snorkling with sharks and turtles was incredible. Exelent and friendly staff and the food was fantastic. Best location and reef! Quiet (far from Male' airport and lokal boat traffic). Best ever -:)
"My wife and I went here for a baby moon and this may have been the best hotel that we have ever stayed at.   Our GEM, Inas, was really attentive and trying to proactively be helpful. All most in an omniscient way he could find us on the island.   The rooms was the perfect layout and we really enjoyed the fact that although it was a more compact room than our other hotel (Gili) the changing air was within the air conditioned zone.  As a remote island and unlike those closer to Male, you really felt a sense of remoteness.   My wife love that the ice cream bar not only had a wide array of flavours but also that they were gratis.   The Diving team and centre was fantastic and allowed me to see some really cool things for the first time like Mantas.   I'll stop most of the review‚Ä¶"
"We had our honeymoon at the Six Senses Laamu and what an experience! We had already stayed at some top 5* hotels on our way to the Maldives and this was the icing on the cake! The moment you arrive you are welcomed by friendly and knowledgeable staff. The location and turquoise blue waters are visually stunning and the villas are just very well made and thought out. Try the Laamu water villas on pier C further down into the water for extra privacy! The food was simply amazing! Every day the food was unique and the seafood was super fresh and well made. The main restaurant manager was always accommodating and helpful - even giving us the humus recipe which was rather delicious! Defo try the scuba diving experience and the movie under the stars.

There's no menu in the room, just call and order anything? :)  They even bring the toaster to the villa, such amusement :)) Lagoon villa also amazing because the blue is unbelievably blue makes me want to jump directly from the daybed.  We love island green ambiance, woody luxury make it so cute and relax, the smell of the wood and lemongrass.  The island contour designed so well to enjoy by bicycle. We enjoy our bicycle ride around the island, from the villa to the restaurant.   We came as couple and find this resort give us the privacy that we need, rarely we found other guests or noisy kids.

"Newly wed and honeymooning, my wife and I stayed at the Six Senses, Laamu for 10 nights in early May 2015. Honestly the most perfect place either of us have ever stayed; the accommodation is fantastic (opt for a sunset water villa for truly unobstructed ocean views) - a kind of perfect luxury Robinson Crusoe vibe, the food is incredible and all of the staff are the friendliest and most welcoming that I've ever encountered at anywhere - the Oceans Dimensions team, the restaurant staff, the management, the Watersports team, genuinely everyone could not have been nicer.   Last but not least - the island itself is of course incredible. The Maldives really are as beautiful as everyone says.

"This is by far the most beautiful and luxurious place I've been! The water villas were simply fantastic and a dream come through. Stayed in nr. 23 on Jetty A - amazing!  Snorkeling at the house reef between jetty A and chill bar was amazing with several turtles and thousands of colourful fish and corals. Scuba diving with Ocean dimensions was fantastic and the staff were really cool! Great food in Longitude with very friendly staff and good service. Tip: make sure you wait until they bring you a menu card for breakfast - great egg dishes and juices/smoothies/coffees (all free/included in breakfast) - missed that the first day.

Don't know what's e 6th sense but reckon its feelings. Satisfied all e above mentioned during our stay.

Felt truely relaxed thru out stay and believe it all starts with happy staff. Thumbs up to e workers who nv seemed to rush or look stressed during duty.. happy staff happy guests.  Thanks again. Will be back soon.
"We spent a wonderful 10 days at Six Senses Laamu at end of April/beginning of May. This was our third visit to the Maldives but first to Laamu. The journey to get there is long, if coming from the UK, I recommend trying to get a direct flight as this is much quicker and easier than having to transfer in somewhere like Abu Dhabi. Unfortunately our journey back was even longer as what was supposed to be a 35 min flight to Male turned out to be over 2 hours as the plane went via another island in the opposite direction! Despite the travel though, Laamu is the perfect place to relax. We stayed in a lagoon water villa (jetty B) and it was lovely. We had a great view of the lagoon out to the ocean, a neighbouring island and could also see the villas on jetty C but they were quite far‚Ä¶"
"the good:  the design of the villas is great, very rustic and understated, nice lagoon, very friendly staff, good food ( not great ) superb vegetation throughout the island, loved the cinema under the stars, good snorkeling, good selection of wines and affordable ones too.   the bad :   we didn't find the long journey from male to laamu was worth it, we expected Six Senses Laamu to feel a lot more secluded, but instead far too many neighboring islands, so we didn't get the usual maldives feeling on laamu. Also the hotel is very overbuilt with too many villas and the lagoon suffered a lot, massive beach erosion with tons of sandbags. The hotel did feel very busy, far too many kids and infants screaming around, the main restaurant complex was incredibly busy, buffet was a‚Ä¶"
"I came with my friends and only stayed 3 nights, we were looking at a business venture in the Maldives, it is possibly the best hotel I have ever stayed in, the location, the water sports, the villas, and the food, oh the food, outstanding!, and the chef cooked for us personally,  The service and the warm welcoming friendly staff are out of this world, Can't wait to return one day."
"We enjoyed a fantastic week at the Six Senses Laamu, Highlights for us were:  1) We stayed in an over water villa with pool and not only was the villa great overall with the luxury you would expect but having the pool made a lot of difference. It meant that we didn't have to leave the villa at all during the day if we didn't want to. We obviously had the glorious ocean to snorkel in but you don't always want to dip in sea water to cool down so the pool was perfect for that. It also meant that we didn't have to sit by the main pool next the the Sip Sip restaurant/bar. Don't get me wrong this is really nice but we wanted a week away for just the two of us, away from babies kids etc and the couple of times we stopped by the Sip Sip there were, understandably, a lot of families‚Ä¶"
Omg. Looks just like s postcard here. Soooo beautiful. Staff very friendly. Food great rooms fantastic & diving unreal. Only draw back is the price. Very expensive especially drinks. Very hot even on cloudy days with short rain showers so rainy season still ok.
"My husband and me have just returned from the most perfect, amazing and best holiday we have ever had at the Six Senses Laamu. I simply cannot put into words how gorgeous this place is, you have to go there to experience it first hand! After a 20 minute boat ride and delicious homemade lemonade, we arrived at the beautiful Six Senses to be met by smiling and welcoming staff and a cold glass of Prosecco. Our Guest Experience Maker (GEM) introduced himself to us and gave us a thorough tour of the resort. Our GEM was called Fayaz and he was simply legendary! Nothing was too much trouble and if we wanted a hotel reservation or anything he always sorted it out for us. He came to say hi to us everyday too to make sure our stay was perfect. Anyway, Fayaz showed us to our beautiful‚Ä¶"
"We spend Easter at this  magnificent resort, everything was stunning the service, the food, the room and last but not least the diving.  In essence an experience for all senses.   We travelled with two children age 6 and 9 and there was something for everybody. I highly recommend a water villa with complete ocean view, it is a treat to get up every morning and just to go directly for swim."
"We went on a 4-night journey at Six Senses on April,2015. It was the first time my husband and I went abroad. Luckily for us to have chosen this beautiful island with fantastic views and excellent services. Life was simple there, sunshines,  beaches, swimming and diving. However, such simple life is of good help for us to forget unpleasant things and restore full energy. Our GEM is Afrah, a very nice guy. On the first day we arrived, he showed us around,and told us about the main activity places.  We speak poor English. Sometimes we have to ask the same thing again and again. However,no matter how many times we asked, he never got bored. We met Sofia on the day before we left at the sunset party at SipSip. She also comes from China.

"Me and my wife just came back from the Six Sense Laamu in Maldives. We really enjoyed our honey moon there. The soft white beach, spectacular view of coral reefs, groups of tropical fishes, sumptuous meals and friendly people, everything make us feel in heven. I also really like the natural and delicate decor of the villa. We had great time and real relaxation there. Special thanks for our GEM, Fayaz, for his great service and guide of snorkeling. Six Sense Laamu really brought a perfect honeymoon journey to us. Shukuriyya!"
"If you are reading this review you are probably trying to decide which island to go to. Basically if you have never been to the Maldives before I am sure most 5 star resorts are simply amazing. If you have been before this is still a very good choice.  The island itself does not look too attractive as you arrive by speedboat as it had 3 jetties of water villas and the ""over the water"" area is two story. Having said that as soon as you step foot on land you are impressed by the beautiful island and architecture.  The lagoon is very large and the villa's driftwood colour makes a perfect contrast to the azure lagoon. A lot of attention to detail in the rustic design of all the buildings.  The vegetation on the island is probably the best we have seen in the Maldives. They must have‚Ä¶"
Having been to Laamu twice before we decided to try somewhere else this Easter. We knew almost immediately that we had made a mistake so called Marteyne (Laamu GM) who said panic not and had us whisked off to her little pocket of paradise within 2 hours. Suffice to say it was as lovely as always and we are going back in October.
"Laamu is perfect. On top of all the Maldivian positives are Laamu's unique bonuses. The island has a great surf break and access to a couple of others. It offers spectacular sunsets and sunrises and of course the nature is vibrant.  Six senses should be heartily congratulated too. They have created a tranquil island that perfectly mixes a laid back atmosphere with a seamless professional service. I loved walking around barefoot the whole time, it really sets the tone. All the staff are happy to be there and great at their jobs.  Our water villa was exactly the honeymoon clich√© we wanted! Also I could check the surf from my bed which is obviously a massive advantage. The food on the island is terrific, both in terms of health (paleo) and taste (5 star). Foodies and crossfitters‚Ä¶"
"When I began looking into the Maldives, I was overwhelmed by the number of resorts available. Luckily, I had an acquaintance who had been to Six Senses twice, and highly recommended that we stay here.  Thank goodness I listened to her because it was the most magical place that I have ever been. Firstly the architecture & design of the resort is breathtaking - all of the restaurants & bars are built over the water with huge glass panels in the floor areas & hammocks & daybeds hanging over the water ready to simply roll in with your snorkelling gear. Between 2 families, we have 6 very active children ranging from 13-19 & I was concerned that they would be bored - not possible.  Twice daily surfing (5 minutes by boat), the most amazing, clear snorkelling & diving right off our‚Ä¶"

"So beautiful, words cannot describe. The island, the resort architecture, the over the water villa, the beach villa, the resort reef, the weather, the staff, the bare feet custom, the food, the free ice cream.  They all exceeded expectations. I'm not one to revisit holiday locations (there is so much to see in this world) but I'm sure I'll return here."
"If you are looking for a place to spend time as a family, a couple or with friends this extraordinary place can accommodate all your needs and wants anticipating them before you even know what they are yourself.  From the moment we were met at the airport and boarded the boat for the Island - gave up our shoes to benefit from the Islands barefoot policy - I knew this was no ordinary experience. First site of the resort are the cluster of sun bleached wooden building on interlinked decks and walkways, floating above the turquoise ocean. Simple at first and then the exceptional detail in their construction become apparent. Our home from home for the next 9 days. We were there as a family - my wife and I and our 2 children aged 11 and 14. Our GEM - Guest Experience Maker - Waheed‚Ä¶"
"Laamu is a amazing place. We stayed 5 days in our honeymoon. Most tranquil and beautiful place ever in there. And they provide excellent service & special food. It needs to take a long time to get there, but it is worth."
"One of our best vacations ever!  This place is so perfect that no pictures or reviews can do it justice. If you like this laid back kind of luxury, where every single detail is thought of, but you don't need to put shoes on for dinner - this place is for you. The villas are gorgeous. We stayed at a laamu  water villa on jetty c, and we didn't regret being a little ""far"" from the restaurants etc. and seriously, what can ""far"" mean on an island 750 meters long? Just a nice 3-minute stroll on your bike.  The food was delicious. We knew it was going to be good but we didn't expect THIS level. We highly recommend the lobster bbq which was a treat.  Yes, everything is expensive. But taking into account the price of the stay it would have been quite crazy to expect that things were‚Ä¶"
"This was our second visit as a family...we intend to return in the 'near' future.   It is a very special place indeed..it provides all the ingredients for a really special holiday..truly great.  Great staff, great attention to detail and probably one of the only places on earth where honeymooners mingle happily with families..that in itself is a great accomplishment.   The pool and sip sip fit very well with the super relaxed mood on the island...a truly Magic holiday..  Very sad to leave but we will be very happy to go back.  The Thomas Family"
"Our dream was to stay in a water villa in Maldives and this week our dream came true.  Laamu is an island paradise that was perfect in every way.  There was a short island hop in a small plane; then another short speedboat ride to the resort.  We were greeted at the Male airport and escorted the rest of the way.  Guests are given a bag for their shoes because everyone is barefoot 24 hours per day.  The warmer months are March and April; we found it necessary to wear sandals on the boardwalks during the heat of the day.  We were greeted our first morning by a small Manta ray swimming near our villa.  The sea is a magnificent turquoise color and the sand is as white as can be.  The staff is very friendly.

It is perfect for a relaxing holiday in the middle of nowhere. Everything on the island works so well, the food is varied and top quality, the spa is outrageous and the villas are luxurious nature. The staff are plenty, very professional and helpful, always with a smile on their face. The views from the villas are unique (hopefully I will master the technology and upload some photos) However we love the water more and snorkelling on the house reef is one of life's greatest moments with so many different forms of marine life whoever you swim. This is only beaten by the scuba diving with sharks and manta‚Ä¶"
"Stunningly Beautiful place, service was excellent, food was acceptable. However, I will not be back anytime soon as  I was unhappy with their billing which overcharged us three times in a row when I happened to check, all three different venues. Although staff were apologetic and worked hard on recovery, the fact it happened three times in  a row got my sixth sense tingling. Reasons given ranged from lack of computer updates to charging a more expensive bottle of sake which we didn't have. The amounts were usually just a few dollars higher. I didn't bother to check all my previous food bills, but if it was a system generated error I hope they would have checked for us and all the other guests."
"The fact that we have returned three times in as many years says it all! The whole ethos of this Eco-friendly resort is attention to detail in every way - the friendly unobtrusive way in which you are looked after by the staff, from the moment you arrive at Male Airport, being met at the local airport and of course in the resort itself. The diving and water sports are simply fantastic! Again it is attention to detail that preserves the pristine corals and marine environment. No site is over dived. The dive masters ensure that you are treated to a variety of sites and cater for all abilities and preferences. It is very reassuring to see that the resort is making a real contribution to the local way of life, improving their prosperity and giving real assistance and employment to‚Ä¶"
The staff couldn't be friendlier. The food was amazing. The diving and snorkeling right from the resort was incredible. We have been to almost every island in the Caribbean and this place is by far superior. We had zero complaints about this place and would recommend to anyone. Fairly new resort and everything was designed and built perfect for the privacy you would want as well as access to everything. If you are going for your honeymoon and are looking for special treatment this place treats everyone special. Everything about this place was perfect and we are really glad we found it.
"A holiday of a lifetime - I will be sure to return...one day!!! From the moment you arrive into Male airport the Six Senses experience begins. For a short wait in Male airport you are taken to a very comfortable lounge in the domestic terminal with light refreshments and complimentary wifi. After a 35 minute flight down to Kadhdoo airport you are greeted by the smiling team from the island and you take the speedboat for about 20 minutes; blowing the cobwebs out from the aeroplane. Your shoes are put into a bag and the barefoot luxury begins, not putting them back on until the end of your holiday.   You are introduced to your GEM and from then onwards you feel totally and utterly relaxed. Nothing is too much trouble on the island, and your GEM is just a telephone call away should‚Ä¶"
"My partner and I were lucky enough to have spent 2 glorious weeks at Six Senses Laamu with close friends. The over water villas were amazing, we loved the barefoot cycling and the spectacular snorkeling with Juerg and the marine biologist.  Picnic Island was a once in a lifetime ‚ÄòRobinson Crusoe‚Äô highlight.  Six Senses resort was full at the time but never felt like it ‚Äì plenty of space and areas to be private or sociable. We enjoyed the ‚Äònest‚Äô SPA treatment rooms ‚Äì recommend you book in advance. Excellent gym too! ‚Ä¶ which you WILL need because there is lots of good food and ice-cream! As hoteliers, we were impressed by the very visual and attentive senior management and GEM teams."
"The TripAdvisor reviews speak for themselves, but it's true. This place has got it right.  The island has a very welcoming and relaxed atmosphere. Most of the villas are water villas which meant that the island itself is quiet. We actually had a beach villa with a beautiful outlook, which was our preference. The resort is big enough to allow flexibility, with lots of things going on at the same time though you're hardly aware unless you want to do that particular thing. The guests are of all ages and although most were younger than we are (in our late 60s) this is not a resort where age is important. There is a nice atmosphere everywhere. We'd been wondering about the DJ in the Chill bar for example, but the music is modern and not intrusive and complements the laid-back feel.‚Ä¶"
"We found it! I have stayed at dozens of 5* Resorts but this is the perfect place. The whole relaxed ""Six Senses"" atmosphere, Food, Service, Location - it does not get any better. Congratulations to the Resident Manager Marteyne and his Team - the whole island is mantained spotlessly and service attentive yet not obstrusive.   It does take quite a while to get there however and we had a longish wait of 4+ hours to connect the domestic flights from and to our international flights, but we were invited to stay in the Airport Lounge on arrival.  Paradise does comes at a price  - while I find the room price high but justified, some wine / Food Options and the acitivies are on the expensive side. The superb ice cream parlour is for free though and my son has used the opiton‚Ä¶"
"My husband and I could not have asked for a better honeymoon. This is the place to go if you're looking for relaxation, incredible scenery and excellent service. We spent 9 days in an overwater villa with a pool at the end of Jetty C. The villa itself is amazing- spacious, beautifully designed and private. The pool was a great upgrade- I recommend it if you're debating between this villa and another. We spent most of our days out on the back deck and in the pool. I wish I could still wake up to that view! The food was fresh and delicious at every restaurant on the island. And biking everywhere was so much fun! It took us about 5 minutes to bike from our villa to the restaurants each night and we always looked forward to it. The path was well lit and so pretty. As far as‚Ä¶"
"My wife and I just spent 11 days celebrating our honeymoon at Six Senses Laamu.  It was unbelievable.  The location of the resort is very unique in that it is the only property in the Laamu atoll.  We spent six nights in an Ocean Villa over the water and five nights in a Beach Villa with a pool - both were fantastic.  The entire staff went above and beyond anything we expected - from the General Manager, Marteyne, to our GEM, Irene, all the way to our villa attendants Asif and Shifam.  The food is incredible and Six Senses makes sure to have a number of different and delicious types of cuisines and dining experiences - Zen and Leaf are a must.  There are many incredible activities - from snorkeling, to dolphin sunset cruises to surf and turf barbeque dinners on the beach.  Our‚Ä¶"
"We had an amazing 6 day, 7 night honeymoon at Six Senses Laamu in March 2015. From the minute our boat pulled up to the resort, the Six Senses staff (including the General Manager and our amazing GEM ‚ÄúGuest Experience Maker‚Äù, Inez) were eager to make our stay a memorable one. We enjoyed the casual, barefoot, Swiss family Robinson atmosphere of Six Senses and would certainly recommend the resort to anyone.  The whole resort is breathtaking!   We stayed in an incredible ocean water villa on jetty A. We enjoyed riding bikes around the island but were happy to be on jetty A, as it is the closest to the community areas of the resort (restaurants, spa, scuba, watersports, etc.).  We were very active during our stay, taking part in 3 scuba dives, 3 paddle boat adventures, 2 yoga‚Ä¶"
"Our 6 days 5 nights stay at Six Senses Laamu is awesome!!!!! We chose Laamu Water Villa for our stay. The design of the villa is superb! You will see the same picture as shown on the website, it 's really amazing!Everything provided in the Villa is great!!!! We are provided with in villa breakfast, and it's lovely to have your breakfast in your villa!!! :) We love the little aroma bag that put under our pillows every night, love the lemongrass body lotion... we love actually everything here!!! Haha...  We love riding our bike to ICE for free homemade ice cream!!!! Ice cream here is so delicious!!!! Haha!! We love staying at Chill Bar too...drink and indulged in the blue ocean! And btw, cocktails there are reasonably priced. Beside, we enjoyed yoga classes provided by Six Senses‚Ä¶"
"We visited six senses laamu fore four nights as part of our honeymoon and fell in love instantly. From the moment you arrive at the resort your are offered to take off you shoes and welcomed by the resort management and team and then introduced to your GEM( general experience maker). This person takes care of literally everything you need and much more and we would like to mention our amazing GEM Afrah. You are then taken on a tour of the resort and then taken to your villa. We were in a lagoon water villa and loved it. Food(4 restaurants) was also very good and we would like to thank the nicest Maldivian staff and their manager Bondor. On top of all of that, the most refreshing ice cream prepared daily in many flavors is offered complimentary all day long. The only thing to‚Ä¶"
"We've been meaning to go to the Maldives for years, but either our budget or holiday time didn't quite fit. So when the stars finally aligned, we wanted to choose the perfect boutique hotel. We're used to shorter breaks, so in the end decided to split our eight nights between Six Senses Laamu and Cocoa by COMO. They both had different pros and cons (Cocoa has better diving and slightly better food, but Six Senses still excels in both these areas and has more than one restaurant) ‚Äì¬†and we're glad we stayed at both ‚Äì¬†but overall Six Senses had the edge for us.  Firstly because it was luxurious while still being rustic and relaxed, so you really felt closer to the beautiful surroundings. The buildings are all as natural as possible, made from wood and other natural fibres. You'll‚Ä¶"
"We are Six Senses repeaters and really loved Six Senses Laamu. What a place, what a service. Highlights were the wonderful snorkeling in the housereef, the magnificent food options (try the romantic sunken table dinner, Leaf and lunch at Sip Sip), cycling around the island with our 2-year old son in the 'backseat' and daily complimentary and very tasty homemade ice-cream (chose anyone of 42 flavors!). And of course the utterly relaxing Six Senses spa. All top quality and best enjoyed the way we like it: barefoot and without fuss. If you have the possibility and are traveling with two couples and children, or as we did as a couple with 2-year old son and his grandmother, don't think twice and book the two bedroom beachfront villa. We had actually booked the slightly smaller two‚Ä¶"
"We had a fantastic experience in Six Senses during our stay. We took the over water villa with a pool on Jetty B with a small coral reef nearby. You can borrow diving gears from the diving center to swim and explore the nearby coral reefs on your own. The over water villas at the top of each Jettys' are with pool. So, if you want to be very close to the corals, those are the villas to choose.  If you are visiting during good weather and don't mind walking, you can take Jetty B or Jetty C. Otherwise Jetty A is a good choice. It is the closest to restaurants, especially when there's rain. Jetty C is the furthest of all.  The resort provides bicycles to move about the island, plus buggy-carts are available to drive you around. And it is great to walk barefoot in the resort.   Our‚Ä¶"
"I have been fortunate enough to travel all over the world and to stay in some amazing places, but my recent visit to Six Senses Laamu was quite simply one of the best!! The resort is just amazing, all of the people that work there are absolutely delightful, the food is stunning and the location in the Laamu Maldevian atoll is heaven on earth of course!!"
"My husband and I went to Six Senses Laamu for our honeymoon and we have never experienced such a high level of service, the food was amazing and the resort is beautiful. We love that you get 100% luxury but on a completely relaxed level."
The meals at the restaurants at Six Senses are mediocre in taste and portions and cost a fortune. Basically the portions are for children and drinks watered down. Not really acceptable for a 5 star resort.
"Im generally not one for resort holidays where there's little to do, however, Six Senses Laamu was one of the most glorious holidays of my life. The resort is blissfully relaxed, the staff are extraordinarily helpful & obliging (but not overbearing) & the other guests are all extremely relaxed & happy. It is one of the most relaxing places I've ever been. The wifi in the rooms is very strong so its possible to work & relax at the same time. The snorkelling out of our bedroom was absolutely incredible & the hotel were able to lend me an underwater camera  to shoot the abundance of fish on the reef. I would go back tomorrow if I could!"
"We absolutely loved our stay at Six Senses Laamu.  We traveled with our 3 children (age 10 months, 6 yrs and 8 yrs), and the children enjoyed it as much as we did.  The hotel is beautiful; the villas well designed; the island stunning; and the service outstanding, especially from our ""gem"" Auzim, the babysitter/kids' club manager, Hanna, and ice cream shop attendant, Abby.    This was our first time to the Maldives.  (We've been back once since then, without the children - to another resort, Gili Lankanfushi‚Ä¶ not because we didn't love Laamu, but because we wanted a place with no connecting flight, as it was a much shorter stay.  But, it's good to have another resort in the Maldives to compare).  Both hotels were fantastic - beautiful beaches and scenery; well thought-out‚Ä¶"
"I just logged in to review this hotel. Me and my parents just left the hotel yesterday and Everything there is beyond expectation. It looks way better than thr photos!!! This is one of the best hotel I've ever stayed. Everything is there for you, just relax and enjoy the moment. There are plenty of activities to keep you busy all day!! Moreover, you get to have your own bike with your name tag!! The service is excellent. Our GEM is helpful. Staffs are friendly. We will come back here again! "
"Corny I know but I wanted to make the heading as eye-catching as possible to give other travellers the opportunity to travel to one of the most idyllic places I have been to.  I have been to several highly rated Maldivian islands before and although all have been simply wonderful, Laamu - in my experience - just edged them into 2nd place.  Laamu is the epitome of an Island paradise and the 11 nights that we spent there could not have been any better.  The trip via Male, then local domestic flight, followed by Laamu speedboat, ran like clockwork and from landing in Male we were looked after by Laamu representatives to make sure the final legs of our journey were hassle free.  On the speedboat the final stresses of normal life were lifted away as we enjoyed the wind in our hair,‚Ä¶"
"Simply breathtaking... Snorkeling off of the ""back porch"" was as good if not better than most snorkeling that you would go on a boat for. If you see pictures of the Maldives and your jaw drops expect to be shocked on how much nicer this place is in person."
"I was taken on holiday to celebrate a big birthday !! Omg !! I loved every single thing about Six Sense Laamu, from taking your shoes off on the speedboat to the island, to the food and the choices there was, our villa was on  jetty C over the water very luxurious from there we snorkelled seeing lovely fish to a turtle.. All perfect !  We felt very pampered and spoiled, the staff are excellent and very friendly, nothing was too much trouble for them. Our Gem was brilliant.  A trip to Picnic Island is a must, to have a deserted Island to yourself for the day was just the 'cherry on the cake ' fabulous weather,  beautiful beach, fantastic blue sea, great snorkelling we feed the fish which ate from our hands, to a lovely picnic with loads of food and drink in it...  A day I will‚Ä¶"
"we had a great honeymoon. Perfect for realxing and de-stressing. Nice food & cocktails. Caring manager who met us in our room to address our concern . Ice cream chief and serving girl were very friendly.     However, our GEM (shi Fu) ignored that this was honeymoon and responed slowly as such we had her replaced. Except for that it was perfect."
"You really do not need shoes! The atmosphere is thoroughly relaxed. The staff however are completely switched on to their guests every need. We felt very pampered and spoiled. The food is very good and the accommodation is luxurious. We loved travelling around the island by bicycle but nowhere is too far to walk, We are scuba divers and found the dive team to be excellent. The dive sites are beautiful and unspoilt with no other divers there but us. There  are lots of different activities on offer but we found we didn't have time to do as diving was our priority. We did use the fully equipped gym and the lovely spa. The cinema under the stars was a nice touch. As soon as we can co-ordinate our diaries we will be booking to return next year."
"Where do you start ! From the management to our GEM we were looked after perfectly ,nothing is to much trouble .we loved our villa on the beach riding round on our bikes is such fun ,the open air cinema showing old movies on sun loungers with the amazing stars above you .Great food we were staying for ten nights (could have stayed longer ) plenty of choice  amazing breakfast .The ice cream parlour which is free and open all day until 10pm is a must ,the young lady serving is a little poppet all very yummy .The diving is AMAZING all the dive masters are helpful friendly and just made the dives such fun and great experiences .If you are thinking of going to Laamu don't think anymore go ,you will not regret it"
"Though it had been two years since I came back from this holiday, I'd made a promise to myself to post a review about this resort - because it was such a memorable holiday! It was the tiny but thoughtful details that made the trip so pleasurable.   I remember when upon arrival at the Male (Ibrahim Nasir) Airport, me and my partner were greeted by a Six senses lama staff and were guided to take a domestic flight to a nearby domestic terminal of the island where their resort was located. Followed by the domestic flight, we were being welcomed by our personal butler (who was  professional and friendly), and guided to take a speedboat trip to the resort. As you can see, it was quite a lengthy travel - but it was well worth the travel into this secluded, peaceful island resort! Not‚Ä¶"
"My husband surprised me by taking me here for our honeymoon in April 2014. We stayed here after a few days at the Luxe resort on a neighbouring island... This resort is the ultimate in luxury. The food was incredible - a mix of Sri Lankan, Indian, Chinese, Maldivian... for a foodie, it was divine. Jewel (the head pastry chef) makes his own gelato in house. There were over 20 amazing flavours with chopped candied nuts as a topping. So delicious! We also loved the fresh organic greens grown from their own garden, homemade jellies and preserves found in the massive, air-conditioned wine cellar with smoked meats and fish at breakfast time. We did the half-board dining plan, i.e. we had breakfast and dinner included. The meals were so large and satisfying that we often didn't need to‚Ä¶"
"We, my wife and I, and our 2 kids 8 + 4 years old, went to Six Senses Laamu for 8 days in the middle of Feb 2015.  And the general consensus is that it was the best vacation ever!  For us it was the perfect fit!  We really feel that the Hotel on their website and other places, is underselling. Everything was beyond what we expected, and we expected a lot! The biggest thing is the STAFF! They are the warmest, friendliest, most service minded people we've ever met. And the staff - guest ratio is very high! Our GEM (Guest Experience Maker, like Your personal guide/fixer/contact) Yasir was just fantastic! And the Ice Cream Bar, with Jewel and Abida.... 42 flavors of heaven (free of charge). Just wonderful! We couldn't have wished for more.  Also the calm, relaxed atmosphere, where‚Ä¶"
"We've been to many 5* resorts such as Oberoi, Banyan Tree, Constance Resorts and more but this February we discovered our favorite hotel group. I've expected a lot from finally visiting a Six Senses Resort and I was not disappointed at all. After quite a long journey from Male Airport with a domestic flight (no water plane) to another island (don't remember the name) followed by a 20 minute speed boat transfer we finally arrived at Laamu.  Already on the speed boat the staff suggests you leave your shoes in a little cotton bag that they hand out and explain that Laamu is a pure barefoot island. I loved it!! we've been to a few other maldivian islands and i found it always quite amusing when women showed up in their louboutin high heels for dinner. the barefoot philosophy works -‚Ä¶"
"Have been to the Maldives 13 times since our first trip in 1984. This was our 2nd trip to this resort and we will certainly be visiting again. Our water villa was first rate and quiet, which is not always the case as some islands pack them too close together. Shamin our villa attendant kept it to a high standard and nothing was too much trouble. We were very well supported by Afrah, our Guest Experience Manager who looked after all our requests and, as he was local, it was fascinating to talk to him about growing up in Laamu Atthol and the history of this amazing country and its rich culture and awesome seafaring. We also benefited from excellent service from Madoob (waiter) with his hilarious, dry sense of humour and his superb English. He was also able to share info on living‚Ä¶"
"Like many other resorts in Maldives, this one unexceptionally offers perfect customer service and a variety of choices for enjoying your vacation. What really impressed us at this resort were the unbelievably beautiful sea colors and night stars. We were shocked at first sight and deeply fell in love with them. I cannot even find a suitable word to describe my feelings when I stood in this lovely, fantastic and amazing nature, just like I was in the heaven. The only thing I was not satisfied with was its limited food choice, compared to its price."
"Six Senses Laamu is an amazing place!!! It is much better live than all the pictures and videos you could watch on the web. The staff greets you from your arrival and they watch for you during the entire stay. They will always fullfil your requests. Our Guest Experience Manager (GEM) Umar was amazing. The food is excellent, starting from beakfast to the room service. For dinner you can chose from four different restaurants. The Villas on the water are incredible, and the island itself is super exclusive."
"Writing this review with an aching heart as we deeply miss our time in Six Senses Laamu! 6 months has passed and there are still fond memories of our short-lived honeymoon there!   We did our research and had requested for a villa on Jetty A not facing the restaurants. We had booked the Lagoon Water Villa and had expected to be housed in one of the villas nearest to the shore but to our surprise, we were told that we were gonna have a free upgrade to an Ocean Water Villa, which was in the middle of the Jetty. Thank you for the surprise and sweet gesture, Six Senses! Our GEM showed us around the villa before leaving us to rest and freshen up. The outdoor shower was a great experience - you either love it or hate it. :) In addition, we also had crabs crawling up the stilts and‚Ä¶"
"Paradise on earth. My wife and I have just visited this wonderful resort for the third time and are planning for the fourth. Maldives is by itself an amazing and beautiful place. The resort can best be described as simple life in a luxury package. Very good and healthy food, home made high quality ice cream, extremely kind service, wonderfull spa treatments, calm anti-stress atmosphere, watersports, wonderful views of the lagune and ocean and amazing reefs with incredible wildlife just beneath the surface."
"We had a fantastic experience at Six Senses Laamu. The facilities are great and the service is truly impeccable. Our Guest Experience Manager was exceptional. The cuisine was remarkable, the Spa outstanding and the fitness facilities excellent. The water villa is simply amazing. It is certainly one of the best holidays we have ever had. The location is so peaceful - you cannot help but to relax!  The water is incredibly clean and inviting."
"I don't know how to get it all down in just a few words. Six Senses Laamu is a magical place on earth.    1. Amazing staff.  2. Great food. I really loved everything. The Al fresco ice cream parlour featuring over 40 flavours of homemade ice cream and sorbet was a favorite stop. Did I mention it was all for free?  3. The spa. World Class. I indulged in the Shirodhara and I left feeling like a new person. While I‚Äôve enjoyed this treatment before back in sweden and on travels, I‚Äôve never experienced anything like this ‚Äì a mind and body altering experience.  4.

"This is a magical place for a holiday - perfect for quite a long stay as there's plenty to find to do and lots of choices on restaurants etc. Incredibly comfortable, great food, fantastic service, I really can't fault it. Desperate to get back there as soon as possible! The staff also take special care to note when you are on your honeymoon. We loved every minute."
I don't even know where to start I still have dreams of this place. My husband and I live in Sol-Cal both are addicted to the ocean and love anything and everything to do with it. It took a while to find ta magical destination to have a private wedding and a nice relaxing honeymoon all in one then we found Six Seneses Laamu!! Upon the long long journey we are greeted by a staff member from the resort and she escorted us from the airport to the boat with no issue  to take us to the Laamu. After the welcome party we met our G.M.  Latheef and our wedding cooridnator Waheed.

We went for boat trip to see the sunset and chase the dolphin. We hired a boat for private snorkel diving. The coral reef underwater is stunning.

"Not a overall 5 but impossible to give only 4. Stunning resort where sustainability meets  rustic luxury making it one of the best barefoot experience one can ever have. Natural beauty, powder white sand, great pool area, clear waters and the most beautiful villas are just a few ingredients for a perfect week away . We spent 6 nights in jan 2015 . Not a single rainny day and amazing visibility due to clarity of the water . Why not 5 star overall????? Although it was probably one of the top 5 villas ( water villa with a pool) I ever stayed in the world the service of the resort  didn't match 100 percent of my expectations, probably due to the fact that we had just arrived from the Six Senses Yao Noi, in Thailand , wich was more the perfect .

"From start to finish, this incredible resort and it's caring and attentive staff provided a wonderful holiday. The overwater villas are luxurious yet eco-friendly, the activities plentiful, and the resort staff anticipates your every need. The restaurant offer diverse settings and food options, and the breakfast buffet is so incredible that you just want to try one of everything every day. A particular favorite is the free ice cream! So many flavors! And the artisan chocolates are beautiful and delicious too. Particular standouts from our trip were our GEM Auzam and a special meal from Chef Martin."
"It's the only resort in the entire atoll. It is eco-friendly and sustainability is key which is important to us. The staff has excellent training and everyone is super friendly. There is a good variety of restaurants offering European, Japanese, Asian and local food. Water quality is superb and the lagoon offers great snorkelling. Corals are in quite good condition.  We spent our honeymoon there. We had an overwater villa (Lagoon) on the jetty closest to the main jetty. Although villas are set next to each other, there is sufficient privacy. There is not really anything we could complain of (which means a lot). It was just fantastic. We would go back immediately if we could afford it."
"My wife and i stayed with six senses laamu for our honeymoon early in Feb and we could not be happier with our stay! The resort itself is beautiful, the photos online do not do it justice. We stayed in a lagoon water villa and loved every moment we spent in it. the team that work there are friendly, hard working and lovely people who went above and beyond to ensure our stay was special. We will definitely be back!  Dave and Nat"
"I can't tell you enough how amazing this resort is. From the facilities, to the staff, to the food, everything was spot on and superb. Must stay in a over water villa. A bit breezy on this side (nothing major) but no bugs and plenty of privacy. Jetty A Sunset View near the end was worth the extra money! Would love to come back again! The only facilities I thought could use a bit of a facelift were the locker rooms in the fitness centre and spa. The barefoot policy really helps you relax and unwind into island life. Lastly, THE WATER! Never have I seen such crystal clear ocean water. If you like to snorkel this resort offers some pretty beautiful corals. Would recommend over and over again!"
"I normally stay at Soneva Gili (Now called Gili Lankafushi) and also Soneva Fushi.  At the time we were booking our trip both our regular hotels were not available so we had to find a new place to go in the Maldives (reluctantly since we love the soneva hotels) but since they were the same group that organized this hotel we thought we may have a chance we may like the place. And yes we had a great time and we loved the place. We were unlucky with the stormy weather but besides that everything at the hotel was excellent. The rooms are smaller than the kind of rooms we had at gili but they were also as special and natural and done in good taste. The outdoor seating area was great because there were plenty of different places to sit, and also the fabulous hammocks hanging over the‚Ä¶"
"We travelled to the Maldives and stayed at the Six Senses Laamu for our honeymoon in July 2014. As soon as we arrived we were greeted by our 'gem' Abdullah, who made our entire stay exceptionally comfortable. He was so accommodating and friendly. We spent ten days at the resort and could not find fault with anything! The staff were extremely attentive. The food was fantastic and chefs would do anything they could to meet our needs as my husband is a vegetarian. The ice cream parlour was our daily treat and the great range of flavours is rather impressive! The resort was beautiful. We had a lagoon villa which was to a very high standard. The d√©cor was creative and vibrant. We had a truly wonderful stay at Six Senses in Laamu and I could not recommend it more highly!"
"Everything was excelent! The rooms were cleaned twice a day, the food was excelent and everyday fresh, the service and the people were very nice with everybody! The location is absolutely incredible and the views like nowhere else! The price worth it! It is great experience and the Maldives is a place that you have to see at least once in your life! "
"My wife and I have just completed a 7 night stay at the Six Senses, having been impressed with their Zighy Bay property in Oman.  It's a lot less glitzy than other similar resorts in the Maldives but we like that whole environmentally friendly vibe. We stayed in villa 68 which is a water villa with pool at the end of jetty C with sunset view. It's a good choice if you like the sun in the afternoon and early evening. We really liked the bike rides that we took everywhere and returning at the end of the evening was magical.   We wanted to rest so weren't really fussed about booking the various activities but we did have a private dinner on the local sandbank which I would definitely recommend, cost is about USD 250 per person and it's a great experience. I used the Gym which faces‚Ä¶"
"We booked a last minute holiday to the Maldives and chose the six senses because of their reputation for fantastic spas, attention to well-being and active resorts. The idea of surfing and doing yoga which is marketed quite heavily on their website also really appealed.  They organised everything really well, and at the last minute. The chap who we met at Male airport was great, the transfer plane was not the best but the boat trip to the resort was great fun and I loved taking my shoes off on the boat(I didn't put them back on again for 8 days which was heaven). The water villas are insanely beautiful and cycling over the jetty at night to the villa, on the bikes they provide is something I will never forget. Try and stay on jetty c if you want to be a bit more secluded from‚Ä¶"

Beautiful and smart decoration in the villas, restaurants, spa... You have bikes to move around the island Barefoot island, so comfortable A lot of amenities, minibar, food options, wines...  - Not the best atoll to go to dive You have to do 50 min domestic flight + 20 min boat from Male before arrive at the resort Bad flight connections, check before your booking to have a cool domestic flight connection (we waited +4 hours in Male before‚Ä¶"
"My husband and I came here for our honeymoon recently. We stayed for 7 nights on their stay 7 pay 6 deal which included breakfast, on a sunset water villa with pool. Our villa was out on Jetty A, villa number 17.   We can't imagine why we actually thought 5 nights would have been enough, by the 7th night, we were wishing we booked for 2 weeks! We were greeted at Male airport, and taken to the domestic lounge to wait for our next flight. Upon arriving at the next airport, we were again met by staff and travelled by boat to Laamu (they provided refreshments and a cleansing towel).  When we arrived, the GEMs were introduced to all new guests, and our specific GEM, Najee, showed us around the resort, and eventually to our room. Najee was excellent in organising everything we wanted‚Ä¶"
Although bigger than most of the Maldives resorts this is sheer luxury overseen by a highly professional general manager. The rooms are spacious and very well appointed.The restaurants are superb with one set up in the trees all serving great food and wines. There are plenty of activities for the family
"I went there for my honeymoon and everyday I wish I could go back! I would love to go back to those clear waters, beautiful ambience, tasty food and splendid breakfast, warm luxirious Villa and more. They are a very eco-friendly place with nothing made of plastic. I loved this about them. Lastly, I would like to give a shout out to our GEM Latif. He made sure our stay was nothing less than perfect.  Hope to return back one day!"
"We stayed 7 days in this absolutely amazing hotel after 3 weeks of honeymoon road trip in Africa and we have to say that our expectations were utterly satisfied! It is like a dream come true... Although you have seen many pictures of the Maldives and of the hotel itself, it surprises you with its impressive landscape, colors and special vibe. The staff were very friendly, the breakfast was amazing with all kinds of food and juices, the overwater bungalows were perfect, etc. We cannot complain about anything. Maybe the price of the wine could be more reasonable... This applies to any extra service or meal which were out of the package. But in general we would say that we paid with no regrets because it was undoubtedly worth it!!! We will come back for sure..."
"Our stay at Six Senses Laamu was dreamy!  We couldn't have had a better honeymoon.  The staff was outstanding: courteous, helpful, kind, friendly.  The resort is gorgeous and they have seriously thought of everything!  Our over-the-water villa was incredible, but also the rest of the resort was incredible too...there were so many equally great places to spend our time (Sip Sip bar, the pool, the beach, the sports center, Chill bar, snorkeling the house reef, diving, the spa, movie night on the beach, boating excursions, at Ice eating sorbet and/or ice cream, and more).  We loved biking around on our personalized bicycles and literally every meal was delicious.  The staff was so gracious, we particularly loved our GEM (Guest Experience Maker) Afrah, the diving staff, the waiters‚Ä¶"
"My wife and I stayed at the SSL in June 2013 as part of our honeymoon. The idea was to do part of our honeymoon as a relaxing and intimate beach holiday with time just for ourselves, while the other part would be spent in a more bustling city atmosphere. Unfortunately, we listened to those friends who said we'd ""get bored with so much island time and have nothing to do"", and only booked 5 days. In retrospect, we could have easily stayed for 7-10 days, and never been bored. Right from the start, when you're picked up at the airport, you're issued small cloth bags for your shoes - the barefoot concept automatically gets you in the right frame of mind. The overwater bungalows provided good privacy, and we were lucky enough to be at the end of a pier, which was simply superb. There‚Ä¶"
"This is my second trip and was very pleased to see all the upgrades to the property. The new central pool and restaurant, villas with pools and added kids amenities were over the top. Service, Food, Activities and spa are best in class. The management and staff continue to exceed my expectations and can't wait to get back."
"I really don't know where to begin. Our Chem: Auzem, our room, the restaurants, the breakfast, the beaches, the pool bar, the impeccable service of all the staff, the sunrise, the sunsets, the amazing gym and last but not least Frans the GM.... were all amazing and very special. I haven't had a holiday like this in a while and I travel a lot. I cannot wait to return to my water villa at the Six Senses. The gym was so gorgeous that we actually trained everyday. I loved the bike rides everyday and the beaches were pristine. I was so sad to leave"
"The design of SSL is spectacular,  all natural materials makes for an authentic island experience but don't think that is at the expense of luxury. This Resort has it all from luxurious over water villas, secluded beach villas, amazing restaurants and public areas and even an all day ice cream parlour where 40 different flavours are available for free!!  The natural beauty of the white sands, the house reef with abundant corals, turquoise waters and an aquarium of fish surround the luscious Jungle island.  The diving is incredible thanks to all the dive team and Oleg for the manta's and the pink reef!  Best of all are the staff thank you to Marteyne,  France,  Arif and all the team who made for an unforgettable stay. "
"My husband and I are just back from the six senses where we went for our honeymoon. We came back extremely happy and had an exceptional time as everything was just perfect!  The top 5 highlights for me were - the beauty of the place, being literally a village in the water  - the exceptional rooms offering great privacy as well as amazing views on the ocean - a luxury rustic atmosphere of very simple but also very designerish looks - the bikes used to move around ten island  - the water sports centre that offers literally everything (and where one can actually use things unlike all other hotels in the Maldives where a waterspout centre is just for the advertising brochure but not for use)  We had an amazing time and hope to be back for a wedding anniversary some time  "
"We visited this hotel on New Year!  +: amazing beach, beautiful ocean, nice weather, good staff, all day schedule for exercises (yoga, aqua, etc), gym has enough equipments, new aeroyoga available too, nice swimming pool area, villas on a water, perfect design inside villas (glass floor in bathroom, sofas outside, so many other things), you go by bicycle on island, professional massage therapists, a lot of water activites -: for NY party it was too quiet, dinner for 3 hours and small party on a beach (nobody tell us what will be there), buffet is not the greatest (as always), very expensive, long way to come from Male (45 min by local plane, 20 min by boat - plus you have to wait flights)"
"It was very peaceful and relaxing at the resort. The over water villas are well designed and the outdoor space at the villa makes it very comfortable to spend the day in the villa. The food at the resort was very good.  There is the main international restaurant and a bar restaurant that serves vietnamese food.  There are 2 speciality restaurants, one Japanese and more Mediterranean, which you have to make a reservation for.  We were there for 6 nights and could only eat at the restaurants the last 2 nights and we tried to make reservations the morning after our arrival.  The staff was very friendly but the service was inconsistent. We had to ask multiple times for things to get done from our butler (they call it the GEM at the resort)."
"We've spent 4 nights on SSL island as part of our honeymoon. It was absolutely a nice, quiet, convenient trip we've ever had. The island is kind of a big family.  SSL is a middle-size island in Maldives, but it was not crowded. Sands were tiny and soft we and every one could take off our shoes barefoot. It was the life style on island.  The staff were so friendly. Our butler (aka. GEM), a lovely Chinese girl named FEI, was so helpful. It's so lucky to meet you as our butler. Thank you so much for serving us and co-ordinate each dinner and water activities. Wish you good luck on this special island and have a happy life with your husband :)  OD(Ocean Dimensions) was the water activities center. Thank you David for teaching us how to snorkel safely. Under water was so amazing. But‚Ä¶"
"When asked what was the best part of our stay at SSL we couldn‚Äôt answer because everything was just so perfect that‚Äôs how great this place is!!   The room was everything and more that we had hoped.  We were on Jetty A so we could snorkel every day straight out from our deck to the beautiful reef, the water was so crystal clear and the fish were so amazing.  Our turtle count was at 6 by the time we left , having done a night snorkel, a reef dive and one turtle even swimming past our deck one evening.  The staff were just so friendly, it makes you more relaxed and happy to be around them.   From the moment we arrived at Male airport it was an enjoyable experience not just a holiday destination.

"There's so much you could say about the Six Senses Laamu but you'd soon run out of adjectives. The greatest thing about it is that from the moment you arrive you can feel the relaxation roll over you. We stayed in an over-water bungalow which quickly becomes our home away from home with an outside shower, sun-deck, access to the ocean, upper viewing deck, twin sinks, beautiful and comfortable bed. The beach,s the staff, the location, the rooms. It's perfect and worth every dollar you pay for it."
"An exceptional resort. World class snorkelling, exceptional privacy in a lagoon villa, and real care for the environment. The most attentive and delightful staff, good food and wine and an unusual sense and for me a most desirable one,  of being nearly alone in the place (except at breakfast),.when the resort was actually full, Given the high price,  I just hope we can go back one day."
"My new husband and I went there on our honeymoon in September. We stayed for 2 weeks and it was fabulous, the holiday of a lifetime. The staff are just exceptional and bend over backwards to make sure you have everything you need and that you don't have to lift a finger.  The food was stunning, and absolutely delicious, we tried almost everything on the menu over the fortnight and couldn't fault any of the food at all. Everything was cooked to perfection. Our villa was cleaned twice a day which was lovely. We did our PADI training whilst there and the guys in the dive centre were fantastic. Everyone was so friendly!  The only negative comment I wiukd make, is that anything over what you've booked and paid for is very expensive. We would love to return here!"
"My husband and 1 year old baby just returned from an incredible 2 weeks at Six Senses Laamu. We went along with another group of friends and we have all said it was the best holiday we've ever had!!! We've been lucky enough to stay at some of the best hotels in the world and this place is truly heaven. We stayed in an over water ocean villa which was stunning - loved the villas and couldn't believe the view each morning when waking up! We then moved into a 2 bedroom pool villa with our friends thanks to a lovely upgrade - it was a great villa for family and friends and just as stunning.  We loved every single thing about Laamu. The staff are exceptional, they are so friendly and yet professional. The food is delicious - special shout out to Chef Mark at Leaf who served us up‚Ä¶"
"My wife and I have stayed in several six-star resorts before, but we never knew this level of luxury until we arrived at Six Senses Laamu. The location couldn't get any better - it is the only resort in the Laamu Atoll which means everything is pristine, untouched and full of life. Just by snorkelling off Chill Bar, we were amazed to see vibrant and abundant corals and fish life (including eagle rays, hawk's bill turtle, green turtle, octopus, moray eels, black tip sharks and giant trevallies) - my wife and I are avid divers, and we found the marine life here to be so much better than many of the dive sites we have been to in Maldives.   The facilities were awesome - our Laamu Water Villa was perched on the lagoon, commanding uninterrupted views of the turquoise blue waters. We‚Ä¶"
6 hours international flight; 40 min domestic flight and another 20min speedboat! It pays off with a caring amazing customer experience! As we arrive midnight; no need to check in with passports but sandwiches were there in the fridge awaiting for us. Dedicated butler service for all arrangements; staff are friendly polite and patient answering requests with smile. Picnicking at sand beach; sailing to chase after Dolphins; touching coral and turtles while snorkelling and visiting nearby islands to experience local Maldivian life are all interesting experiences that one should never missed ! Rooms are beautiful and bicycles are a standard feature for each room. Excellent seafood and amazing Mediterranean style buffet breakfast served with unlimited free flow  of champagne! Also‚Ä¶
"Amazing place. So exotic and relaxing. Great service. Great Lagoon Water villas. Great restaurant(s). Only ""complaints"": Poor wifi connection in villas, prices in restaurant and Chill bar very high (a bottle of wine is min. $200 when including the 22% surcharges), the Leaf restaurant not very good..."
"We spent our New year with the family at Six Senses. From the time we arrived at the local airport and picked up by the Hotel speedboat, they sweep you off your feet in stylish and very courteous service. As soon you get off the boat before check in, you are greeted by the Hotel GM and you are assigned a personalised host for the duration of your stay, who is available for all your requirements/bookings etc 24/7. For each villa you have personal bikes to move around the vast island and hotel facilities. You can dive into the sea from your villa or sun bathe in your own deck or go to the Hotel pool. Overall, amazing facilities with impeccable service. Great food and awesome cocktails and Sheisha. Expensive, but all good things in life comes at a price!"
"We have just returned from our third visit in four years to the Six Senses Laamu, it just gets better everytime. They have added pools to some of the beach villa which we werent sure would add to the experience as the blue sea is only a few steps away but we were wrong they were great. clear fresh water for a cool dip whilst soaking up the sun, was super. Our GEM (Abdulla) took great care of us nothing was too much trouble, he found us a few times a day and ensured we had everything we needed. We have stayed in both water and beach villas during our visits the beach villas are huge with loads of space and differnt levels to enjoy, we requested and stayed in villa 84 (with pool) which is just beautiful it faces the sea, its not close to the bars etc so very quiet.

I have stayed  for 4 days at Six Senses Laamu.  Arrival: From Male you need to take a 35min domestic flight (not seaplane) and continue with a 20min hotel speed boat.  At every connection is a Six Senses representative waiting for you and guiding you to the next plane or boat. From the boat you can see the beautiful crystal blue water with the villas and island shape. Your own butler and hotel manager awaits you at the welcome building.   Room: This is the best from the whole island. Best rooms I ever had. We stayed in the standard category which was a Lagoon Water Villa. 120 square meters with 2 levels. Huge balcony where you can jump into the clear Indian ocean. Awesome! Check the internet pictures or youtube videos. WOW!!!! As well the outdoor shower is fantastic (you will be‚Ä¶
"My wife and I choose to stay at 6 Senses for our honeymoon. Stayed in the water villa for 5 nights.  Overall, I would say our stay was decent, with few things that the resort could improve upon  1) Our GEM has no value.  He didn't make our experience any better.  He was simply there to book things, which I could've done myself.  On one night we didn't want to dine at the buffet, and called him to make a reservation at Leaf. He told us all restaurants are closed on buffet night.  My wife and I later found out from another guest upon departure Leaf was actually opened.    2) The restaurant staff keep pushing wine to us on every meal.  It got more annoying by each meal and dinner experience became less and less enjoyable.  3) The biggest deal breaker for us was upon departure. ‚Ä¶"
"Writing this review on my last night here at Six Senses Laamu. My wife and I came here for four nights for our honeymoon and had a wonderful time.   Arrival: I landed night before and stayed at Trader's Hotel. The next day, we met a SSL rep at the airport who took us to a lounge to wait for our domestic flight. The lounge was decent, had wifi and some food and drinks. The domestic flight was about 40 min, then a roughly 15 min boat ride to the resort.  Villa review: I stayed one night at a Lagoon water villa and three nights at a Laamu Villa with pool. I cannot comment on beach villas but they looked very nice, had a ""in a jungle"" feel, and had your own private beach. The water villas are awesome, exactly as they are portrayed on those beautiful pictures. If you want value‚Ä¶"
"We visited Six Senses Laamu for our honeymoon, with a week in this property followed by a week at another island further north, closer to Male. After a 10 hour flight we thought the connection to Laamu may be tiring but we were wrong, it was seamless.  A 35 min domestic flight and then a 20 min speedboat which was waiting for us when we arrived made the whole experience even more enjoyable after almost 24 hours without sleep!   Firstly we were not disappointed Laamu totally delivered, and some! With so much choice in the Maldives and this being my 5th return to this gorgeous paradise I'd totally recommend Laamu to both families and couples as the facilities are excellent and cater for absolutely everyone.    We stayed on Jetty C (which is the furthest away jetty, and most‚Ä¶"
"We have been travelling a lot. Unfortunately not so good at writing reviews, but we have been staying in all sorts of resorts all around the world.

"Six Senses was wonderful!  We were in a Laamu Water Villa with Pool.  The villa was at the very end of Jetty C.  It was so secluded and private!  It was a long way from the main area with all of the food and activities, but it was quiet and peaceful.  If you are looking for some rest and relaxation, Jetty C is great.  Each villa comes with a pair of bicycles, so you can ride everywhere you need to go on the island.  The ride from Jetty C to the restaurants and activities was probably about a mile.  If you want to be close to everything, request Jetty A (but keep in mind you will either be overlooking the restaurants or Jetty B).    We went during off season (wet season), but it mostly rained at night.  There were several storms, but only one during the day.  The days were bright‚Ä¶"
"This is the most incredible resort i've ever stay  I wanna say big thank you to the staff at six senses maldive  ( specially to sifu ) they were so helpful, kind and genuinely thoughtful, they really made our trip to maldives.. I could not recomend this place more highly..  Thanks again sixsenses laamu maldives , i had incredible and truly memorable stay."
"This place is heaven for snorkeling  and scuba. We swam from our water villas to the house reef every day when we snorkeled for hours before swimming back. Amazing reef in crystal clear water - unspoilt and teeming with fish. And it is a long reef so you hardly ever share the water. Ranging from 1 to 18 meters deep.  The service at this resort is great. The food good and the rooms and especially  the bathrooms are fantastic.  Thank you, we loved everything."
"Six Senses Laamu was just the perfect venue for a fantastic vacation. Getting there is a (charming) journey and, from the minute your speedboat docks, it's luxe service all the way. The resort is beautifully laid out, the facilities are top-notch (we used both the gym and the spa), the villas fantastic (we had a lagoon beach villa), the service excellent, the staff very well-trained, the food and drinks excellent etc etc. You couldn't fault a single thing. The fact that you need to get around on bikes, barefooted, just adds to the charm. It is puzzling that some people apparently have complained about a lack of a pool - with that extraordinary ocean at your feet, it's not something I felt was missing - but construction is underway for a pool in any event. We were there for 7‚Ä¶"
"We stayed at Six Senses Laamu at the end of Sept/early October 2014. The experience was absolutely incredible and it will now be very hard to holiday any where else without comparing this to Six Senses.  We stayed in an overwater bungalow half way along in the B Jetty.  This was perfect for us as we had privacy and peacefulness as well as the wonderful experience of riding our bikes as a family along charming sandy tracks in the bush to reach the restaurants, bars and shops.  If you have mobility issues, I would recommend that you opt for Jetty A which is much closer to the main amenities.  Our thanks goes to Marteyne the General Manager who made us feel like we were special from the moment we arrived.  The staff were all welcoming, well trained and efficient.  Our GEM Shifu‚Ä¶"
"We stayed at six senses for the last two weeks at the end of October. We had a fantastic experience from beginning to end. The staff were all very polite and helpful. Our guest experience maker Mastouek was helpful and organised whatever we needed and informed us of events taking place. During our stay we enjoyed the following experiences -  - went on a boat trip to an uninhabited island, we saw stingrays gliding along the water, baby sharks and flying fish. We went snorkelling on that trip as well and saw some beautiful fish. The island was stunning, out of this world.   - went on a dolphin sunset cruise and saw lots of Dolphins jumping out of the water and flipping around.

"We visited six senses lamuu for our honeymoon this august. 7 night stay we thought that was perfect. We are so amazed about the ambiance on the resort, all the friendly staff - we will remember them for a long time. As an alergic person, I am not used to get everything on the menu, and used to get a limited offer, after our stay in six senses i had almost forgot that i was allergic. The food was devine. All the activities also made our stay exeptional, as my husband does not read books, we had to have some activities. With snorkling, diving we did something new every day. The resort even had marin biologist, we saw turtles get born, we met dolphins, saw turtles close up while snorkling.....the list is long. Bottom line, we talked to many other guests that had been other places‚Ä¶"
"Two weeks spent relaxing at this resort is just the ticket for a hectic lifestyle. Very attentive service, good food and excellent diving with a friendly dive school. And an added bonus of the Manta Trust charity being present to provide their expertise about the manta rays that pass through the area. Food is top notch and varied. Even the bar area had excellent food to choose from helped along by a great DJ and music at the ""Chill Bar"", we don't normally like music blaring when in the Maldives, but this DJ pitched it just right with the volume and music selection. We'll definitely be back for more."
"We spent 10 nights at Laamu Six Senses for our honeymoon on August 2013. First of all, it took us 24 hours to get there but it was well worth it. The staff is very welcoming and helpful. The room (we stayed on the water jetty C) was very very spacious and absolutely perfect. They provide you with bicycles since all entertaining is in one area and a about 15 min walk, or 7 min bike ride. If it's raining or dark they will drive you to your room and your bicycles will be by your door when you wake up. The room service is very quick and lots of variety.

"I spent 13 absolutely amazing days in 6 Senses! I loved everything - accommodation (I had a water villa), beach, ocean, jungles, food in the restaurant, corals, fish, crabs... The hotel has a very attractive policy - at least, for me as a megapolis citizen - the policy of bare foot: you do not need shoes, sandals or flip-flops, and can walk with your bare feet in any place in the island (or ride a bike, if you are a biker). Water villa provides you with an opportunity to explore the ocean right from your villa, and you can have crabs as guests on your veranda, and fish would be delighted if you feed it with bread - and you would be happy to make pictures! And what I liked most of all is people - the hotel staff, people who do everything to make you happy: waiters, spa staff ‚Ä¶"
"Just returned from our two week honeymoon at Six Senses Laamu. From the minute we stepped off the plane at Male we were treated like Royalty. Everyone we met was friendly, helpful and polite and we knew we had made the right choice in booking here. When we arrived off the boat we were greeted by the management team and were introduced to our GEM, Afrah who was very welcoming and took us straight to our water villa on Jetty B with a sunrise view as we requested. The villa was perfect and the view and colour of the sea completely blew us away. The sun was shining and the weather was perfect and we setlled in very quickly. We ate at all the restuarants over the course of the honeymoon and we loved everything we had. A special mention goes to Shiyaz in the Chill bar for serving us‚Ä¶"
"Many others have detailed descriptions about how amazing the accommodations and service is. I ditto what they say. As you would expect from a resort that charges $1000+++ usd a night, the resort was spectacular.   What I really want to tell you about is the breathtaking location of six senses laamu. Yes, it is a long journey to laamu from male airport, but it is worth it. You feel so far away from civilization. The colors of the water are like none I've ever seen before and different from other areas of the maldives. The beaches were soft sandy white, and the house reef was stunning. I will never forget the brightness of the Milky Way Galaxy and stars at night or the double rainbows that would form after the rain.   I hope I get to go back one day."
"Just back from 2 weeks Laamu Six Senses. The review shall provide some indications of what to expect  and not when you choose Laamu Resort. We travelled as a family with an 11-year old daughter and we can compare the resort to several others (Soneva Gili, Fours Seasons Kuda Hura, Fours Seasons Landaa, Kanuhura, Island Hideaway, Constance Halaveli, Lilly Beach and Moofushi). First let me say that all resorts we have been to are great and can be recommended, all have their little specialities and differences (which is good and which is the reason we tend to change resort very often). Maldives are paradise by definition of its setting, nature, reefs, marine life and climate. So, all comparisons are done at a very high level of comfort and luxury. If someone manages not to be happy‚Ä¶"
"My husband and I have just got back from 7 nights at SSL for our honeymoon (after a week travelling around Sri Lanka).   We are fortunate to have been to mainly lovely places over the years, but SSL Maldives took my breath away and exceeded all (very high!) expectations.  Without exception every single member of staff is a credit to their team and I only wish I could individually thank them all. Our transfers were smooth - instantly greeted by a SSL Rep at Male airport who whisked us and our luggage away to a lounge, checked us in and whisked us off again to catch our next flight. One 20 min speed boat ride later (with chilled homemade lemonade) and an introduction to the very welcome ""no shoes"" policy, we were being greeted by the friendly faces of the staff at SSL.

I personally liked the bathroom (shower) in water top villa where the shower was outside and I could feel the fresh air and hear waves... The bath tub was right next to it and it made me feel so luxury, Each room comes with a set of bicycles which we used every day to get to places.

From the minute we arrived to catch the speedboat to the island a sense of relief and relaxation washes over you. The escorts at the airport take care of everything as well as providing you with a refreshing drink and a little bag to remove your shoes (we didn‚Äôt wear shoes for 10 nights - fantastic!)  We stayed for 10 nights 24 Sept ‚Äì 04 Oct. Perfect amount of time!  Everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful whenever we had a question or wanted to check our bill. Our GEM was Arif and he did everything he could to ensure we had an amazing stay and with me constantly changing our plans he didn‚Äôt miss a beat! On the few days where it was rainy and our activities were interrupted he was very quick to let us know what other activities were available inside. While there you each‚Ä¶
"We are just back from a 10 night stay at SSL where we celebrated our honeymoon. In summary, the place is incredible with service to match. The only downside of a holiday here is the travel time involved (we flew from Europe and outward journey took c. 36 hours). Simply put, the journey out was painful but ultimately worth it. We arrived in Male airport at c. 2pm to be told that it would be a 2 hour wait for the domestic flight. In reality it was a further 5.5 hours before we actually flew out of Male - an unexpected and unpleasant stop over. Arriving at the resort at c. 9.30pm was far from ideal and we couldn't help but feel that we had missed out on our first days holiday. However, the welcome and service that we received from the moment we stepped on the speedboat quickly‚Ä¶"
"As newly weds my wife and I had a wonderful stay at Six Senses from September 26 to October 6 2014. From the arrival at the airport at Mal√© until we left again.  Our GEM, Ishan, was considerate about asking us if we were on our honeymoon and he made our stay extra special. Thank you.  At our departure we did unfortunately not have the chance to see some of your staff, Yusuf and Amir from the Longitude and Shiyaz our villa Attendant and hope they received our extra tips for them. And we would especially thank Hisham from Longitude because of his kindness and talkative nature.   Unfortunately at departure our domestic flight Kadhoo to Mal√© had technical problems which meant we missed our international flight. Representatives from Six Senses took care of us the couples of hours we‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses Laamu is far, far away; in our case a journey of some 22 hours from door to door. But, it is worth it! The whole experience kicks of already in Male airport where we were greeted by the local representative from the hotel that followed us to the lounge. Hereafter awaits a short domestic flight before a 20 minutes speedboat ride took us our final destination. Upon arrival we were widely meet by the hotel manager and our kind GEM ‚Äì Guest Experience Maker ‚Äì who acted as our point of contact for the rest of our stay.  There are truly many wonderful things to say about Six Senses Laamu. We stayed in a Lagoon Water villa on jetty B, an entry level villa, but in our view just perfect. The decor is stunning, the deck is super large and there is a very high degree of privacy.‚Ä¶"
"The resort was everything we could have hoped for. Our villa was beyond compare, the photos on their website do not do this justice. If you can spring for it then we recommend you get an ocean view water villa which gives an uninterrupted view of the ocean (without the views of other villas). The facilities in the villa are wonderful, from the outdoor shower, the glass bottom bath, the Bose Soundsystem, to the rooftop terrace where you can lay and look at the stars. The staff are always eager to please and help with anything you could ask for. Our GEM Auzum was wonderful and friendly and wanted to go the extra mile for us on anything we asked for. The restaurants were wonderful with a great selection and amazing quality of food. We especially recommend Zen if you like sushi and‚Ä¶"
"I guess in a way, every island in maldives is beautiful. The country is blessed with clear blue waters and endless islands.   There is only so much you can plan ahead but the weather is simply not within our control. It rained for 4 out of the 5 days that we were there, so I can only look blissfully at our outdoor patio and wished for better weather. The huge plus is that the breakfast is amazing. The spread is a combination of ala carte and buffet, which means you can order your main course roundabout anyway you want it. They also have a cheese and cold cuts room where you can get stuffed with a wide selection of cheeses (bikinis are not exactly useful when it is raining). Drink up the champagne, watch the strong seas, and we figured it wasn't such a bad place to be stuck in a‚Ä¶"
"Stayed in this resort for 5 nights, definitely it was not enough.  View - excellent. Enjoy blue sky, clear water and fresh air. Food & drinks - lots of choices from buffet dinner. Ice-cream, dessert and wine are very good. Staff - helpful, considerate and friendly.   I enjoy the GM cocktail very much!  And, massage and yoga class are professional."
"We spent 5 nights in kandooma before arriving at six senses for 7 nights. Very different islands, both with great attributes and excellent food/bev standards and staff. The food in the Maldives is some of the best and most varied I have had in my travels. Buffets have taken on a whole new meaning!   Six senses offered a more upmarket vibe and we thoroughly fell in love with our over water villa, ""best bathroom ever"" my man said. We were a bit more exposed on jetty c and occasional swells were noticeable during the night, they did offer to move us but we didn't bother. We got a longer ride through the tropical jungle!  Loved the bikes, the reefs, the jungle track and most of all the surf crew, chill bar staff and DJ Bar'el. During the day we interacted mostly with Steve, Unice,‚Ä¶"
"4.5 Stars   We are staying at Six Senses Laamu for 10 nights...We are currently on our 6/10 days. It is raining today, hence, we are writing a review  (Will update more after the vacation). It rained 3/6 days so far.  So here it goes.   We arrived at male airport and spotted a six senses staff.  He took us to an airport lounge to chill there for a bit while we wait for our next flight to Kadhdoo airport.  The flight was about 40min and In that little small airport (Kadhdhoo Domestic airport) someone from six senses picked us up and we rode on a speed boat for approximately 20 mins to the resort.    After arrival, six senses' staff all greeted us and they would give you a shoe bag for you to put in your shoes in it (they encourage barefoot in this island at all times). We were‚Ä¶"
"Thank you for the wonderful and unforgettable experience.   Our over-water bungalow and the retreat is absolutely stunning but what made our stay so memorable is the team and the incredible personal service. You do it so well. Special thank you to our personal Host Ravah who could not do enough to assist. You ensured we had the most amazing stay. Thank you.  We can't wait to visit again in the future and we will certainly be recommending to many of our family, friends and colleagues.  Thank you, Thank you, thank you!

"In August 2014, my husband and I celebrated our 10 year anniversary at this fabulous resort. We have spent many years travelling to various five star accommodation around the world and have to say that this is definitely in our top 5 and would have to be my favourite beach resort. Our GEM, Irene, was fantastic as were all the staff.  We thought the GEM was a great idea as she kept us fully informed of all the events that were happening on the island, (as did the weekly timetable that was delivered to our room) and ensured that all our requests were taken care of. The staff at the restaurants, particularly Leaf were so friendly and accommodating.  I have to say that given the service I have experienced in London and Queensland lately this was very refreshing. The food was‚Ä¶"
My wife and I spent 14 glorious days at the Six Senses Laamu and we had the most wonderful time. Everything about the resort demonstrates their care and dedication to excellence. Despite being a secluded island you always feel there is something to do and even if the weather doesn't always play fair the team at the hotel go above and beyond to ensure that you have the most memorable experience.  We especially liked the attitude the hotel has towards relaxation and the environment. Their care towards the resources they have at hand and the tools and materials they use to maintain the island shows how much they all really care about ensuring their survival for future generations.
"First let me say I would not over exaggerate or try to demean any property as I love trip advisor and know many business owners who thrive on reviews...as you can see from my profile most of my reviews are always positive, but I am afraid here I need to inform people about this property.  We came here for our honeymoon and to be frank were sorely disappointed. I would never recommend this place to a friend. My husband got food poisoning after eating at their organic restaurant and they didn't even apologise or have anyone speak to us regarding it...  The front desk sent a doctor which was great (yet expected) and he stopped by four times because my husband was so ill and bedridden for more than a day (4 different meds were prescribed) but we never heard from management.

"I'm not a believer in anything being perfect because we should all strive to do better and after our first visit in 2012 we went back in August 2014 because it was the closest thing to perfection I have ever witnessed and experienced. However, I was wrong and glad we went back because it WAS better. The staff, in particular our GEM Auzzam were of the highest standard of customer service we have ever experienced. Their attention to detail is imppecable, cocktails and drinks mouth watering and the food would fit perfectly into any world class fine dining restaurant in the world. The couple my partner and I went with share our view adding that it was better than they expected and that the pictures we showed them from our 2012 trip, doesn't do Six Senses justice. Thank you to‚Ä¶"
"Stunning location. Beautiful rooms with attention to detail.  This is a fantastic place for relaxation.  Food is excellent but expensive so make sure your budget is prepared.  Most activities also cost extra.  We were in a room on the jetty farthest from the main facilities and enjoyed the bicycle rides daily so if that's not you, request closer accommodation.  Had issues with transfers to and from."
Myself and my wife travelled here for our honeymoon in August and were blown away from the first moment we stepped onto the speedboat. Although it is a bit of a trek from Male airport it is very much worth the effort. The staff are the best I have ever witnessed with complete attention to detail and they make everything seem more personal. By the second morning the waiter at breakfast knew our names and we were welcomed everywhere we went with a smile. We went snorkelling two days and both times the instructor was very knowledgeable. We also did a sunset dolphin trip and went to the Spa. Each experience was better than the last. There is also both paid and free water sports to enjoy and once again the staff here are friendly and keen to help you in whatever way they can.   There‚Ä¶
"Yes, this is a top hotel, there's no doubting that, the food, service, staff, and above all the accommodation were all 5 star. What was wrong with it then, why have I given it only 3 out of 5? It's because of the price. I have stayed in plenty of 5 star resorts in my time, and this was getting in for double the price of the next most expensive one I've stayed in, yet no better, or hardly any better. My advice is - if you have money to burn, stay here, for sure, but if you are after value for your hard-earned cash, this isn't the place to find it."
"If there is such thing as paradise is here at six senses. They welcome you from the moment you step foot on Male till the moment you leave. The concept is amazing, beautiful and rustic. Below is my detailed review.   Getting here: This is tricky, you have to fly to Male from whenever you are, then take a domestic fly to nearby island and a speed boat to get to lamau. It's long, tiring but worth it.   Accommodations: The villas are amazing, over the water, beautiful, cozy. It feels like you don't even have to leave the room to have a good time. It also comes with bicycles to travel around the island.  Attractions: Water sports are very good and with plenty of options. Canoes and snorkeling gear complimentary which is very nice. You can canoe and snorkel any where in the island.‚Ä¶"
"We stayed at Six Sense for 5 nights in August 2014. We loved many aspects - the actual resort itself was beautiful and everything had been considered. The staff, led by Marteyne, could not have been friendlier or more helpful. They thought of everything and remembered all of our preferences throughout our stay. The barefoot philosophy made us extremely relaxed and is unique, especially in 5* resorts. The relaxed feel extended throughout the whole resort. However, service did not slip because of it. The sommelier was excellent, and the staff at the dive centre and surf shack (Steve) were excellent. We felt as though we were welcomed into their home. The resident DJ really made the final touch - DJ Bar'El really added to the already outstanding atmosphere (incredibly nice person‚Ä¶"
"The title says it all!  This was our 3rd visit to the Maldives - surely not our last! - and we definitely picked a winner this time! Perfect huge lagoon, wonderful over-water villas, nice beaches, very eco friendly, wonderful, tasty organic food - some locally grown - fantastic local people - even women this time around! - and simply GREAT SERVICE! Nothing seems to be too much trouble and anything you ask is possible.. I had the most magnificent birthday celebration of my life on a beautiful sandbank with a wonderful sunset to accompany it. There is something for everyone on this resort, but I would strongly recommend an over-water villa preferably not the first few in every jetty, as the waters there are NOT crystal clear. Much nicer as you move deeper in the lagoon... So go‚Ä¶"
"Between my partner and I, we have travelled all over America, Caribbean, Amalfi Coast Italy, Greek Islands, Cook Islands and more. But absolutely nowhere compared to this beautiful hotel on this unforgettable island. I couldn't put into words the experience we had. Seven nights was not enough in our beautiful over water  bungalow #63 on Jetty C.  Which is unusual for us as we are always happy to come home, enjoy our life, make more money for the next holiday. But not on this holiday. Not in this magical romantic surreal part of the world. Our mission now, is not to outdo this holiday or replicate it, as we know it is not possible, but to find the second best place in the world to holiday. In 3 words, breath-taking, unforgettable, unrepeatable. "
"We went for our honeymoon in 2013 for 7 nights and it was PARADISE!! From the moment we touched down at the airport to departure, the service was flawless. Even the ferry ride to the island was attentive - with fresh watermelon juice or iced homemade herbal tea and a chilled lemongrass infused wet towel to freshen up after a long day of travelling. Of course, this service continued as we stepped foot on the resort. We had our own butker and I'm annoyed at myself for not remembering his name to write here. But he was faultness. Very polite, friendly and helpful. Also delivered a honeymoon chocolate cake to our room :)  The resort was newly built so was in pristine condition. We LOVED the trendy rustic charm and the eco-friendliness of it. We noticed more couples (mostly young)‚Ä¶"
I'm writing this review on my last day of an amazing 9 night stay at Six Senses Laamu.  The experience begins at Male Airport where you are met and shown to a nice lounge with drinks/food etc to await your domestic flight here.  A scenic short flight (about 35 mins i think) and you arrive at a remove airport to be whisked to Six Senses via comfortable speedboat.  On arrival you are amazed at the driftwood structures and this looks like some kind of environmental disneyland for adults !!   It only gets better...we elected to stay 5 nights in a lagoon beach villa and 4 nights in an ocean water villa (over water).  Both were equally divine in their own way.  I recommend a combination of both if you have the time as you really get a great experience in both.  The beach villas are‚Ä¶
"This was our first visit to maldives. We were there on the 1st week of August and spent 4 nights on Laamu water villa and despite the monsoon season we were blessed with great weather to our delight.   The place is an absolute paradise for even non-swimmers like us. They place lots of emphasis on preserving nature. The service is good and special mention should go to out GEM Arif. In our short stay , we caught glimpses of beautiful fishes from the jetty, spotted a pair of baby sharks and even saw dolphins on the boat ride back. The beach is pristine and blue as can be.  Our villa numbered 74 was spacious and best part was the shower area. The beds were comfortable but pillows a little soft. The only disappointment was that being non swimmers it was a little too deep to get down‚Ä¶"
"I agree with most of the comments. Great water sports and spa, world's best yoga and cooking classes, turtles and dolphins shores, friendly staff, you own your own bikes, incredible rooms and food, service is none-stop with your own butler from arrival to departure, and on top of that, FREE UNLIMITED ICE CREAM! I'm shedding a tear while leaving the island.   The only deal breaker is that you have to take a domestic flight and a speedboat to get here, which is very tiring, scary and annoying."
"The long distance and the several flight to reach this remote location are really worth it. It is not only because you will be surrounded of an amazing landscape but also the staff who will make your stay unique. I would like to underline the friendliness and warm welcome in the Spa, Dive center and Water Sports center. Steve and his fellows will help you feel at home. You will borrow the snorkling equipment at no extra cost. Don't miss the ice creams and try the diversity of all the restaurants. We had the picnic in a remote island and don't regret it. Snorking near the overwater is ok, but don't miss the opportunity to take one of the organised trips to snorkle to another spot. There are not many things to improve a place where it is environmental friendly. The transfers‚Ä¶"
"Actually we got what we came for. The island and infrastructure is really beautiful and the resorts approach to provide its service as sustainable and environment friendly as possible (they have their own herbs and vegetable garden, water bottles are recycled....) make the place something special. Most of the infrastructure is built from wood and where ever possible buildings, restaurants and so on are built directly over the sea or on top of a tree, which gives the place a special romantic zen aura. The sea life is gorgeous and the dive base team was very kind and proficient. The restaurants deliver top cuisine and spa is also excellent with a great view (according to my wife).   I gave it a four star since the overall attitude of the staff was always correct but in my opinion‚Ä¶"
"My wife and I usually go to Europe for our summer holiday, but this year, instead of one long trip, we decided to do a few short trips. This was our first time in the Maldives, and I don't think we could have done much better in terms of value for money than the Six Senses Laamu. Looking at the pictures on their website we were already pretty excited, but pictures cannot do it justice.  Before setting off, my only concern were the travelling arrangements, which weren't very clear from my travel agent. However, a quick call to Six Senses and it was explained quickly. We arrived in Male at night, and had to take a domestic flight to Kadhoo Airport, and then a 20 minute speedboat ride to the resort. I had my reservations about arriving in darkness, but the way the resort was lit‚Ä¶"
"First off I must point out that this was not our normal standard of resort or holiday - we do not frequent the maldives or luxury resorts and this was a once in a lifetime trip for our honeymoon and we found PARADISE!  After months of saving and using wedding gift money we finally decided on Six senses Laamu - and after 8 wonderful days on this beautiful resort im so glad we chose Six senses, we've never been to the maldives and are unlikely to be able to afford to return to the maldives but i can say without doubt that six senses was the perfect resort for us!  There is a ""way of life"" or Ethos of the resort of luxury while remaining a rustic charm but also of relaxation, quality, service and environmentally friendly ways. From the moment you arrive on the boat you are offered‚Ä¶"
"You can spy on darting fish from your glass-bottomed bath tub and watch movies in the jungle. . You can surf Ying Yangs just a short boat ride away and get the wave of your life with turtles popping up next to you. But wait there is more... If that's not enough, they have FREE ice-cream from the parlour, all day every day. 30 something flavours! You ride your bike everywhere around the resort and you can snorkel around the restaurant and bar area. It's simply amazing."
"My wife and I had a wonderful ten days here. We simply can't think of a better beach get away and although it's been a 6 months now we wanted to write a review because we enjoyed it so much. Great diving and snorkelling, friendly staff, your own personal bikes, AMAZING rooms, brilliant food and what a location! Oh and they even have free ice creams. What more could you want. The only piece of advice we have is don't read too many of the reviews or spend too long looking at the pictures because it's great to discover everything when you get there. We're already booking to go back - if you're even thinking about going to the Maldives go here."
"Both my wife and I had a wonderful one week stay at the Six Senses Laamu - Maldives.  The resort was superbly marvelous, and accolades should go to the management and team there for keeping this resort one of the best jewels in Maldives.  What makes it all so special are the committed staff there that were always going out of their way to create dreams and memorable experience for all guest to the lovely resort, and the GEMs (Guest Experience Makers)were the key success to the resort's distinctive brand and service-oriented culture success. Special mention and thanks should go to Abdullah Hassan/GEM who made our stay so comfortable and wonderful. He is one of the resort's key success story for the resort's many other GEMs. He is not only passionate about his role as a GEM, but‚Ä¶"
"We've spent the last 4 summers in Barbados and we knew that we needed to dip our toes in different water. The big problem was that Barbados has got lovely people, beautiful scenery, great food and the standard of accommodation was incredible. Our excellent travel agents, Angelfish, therefore had a very tough act to follow. We wanted great snorkeling, great food, great accommodation and we eventually put our faith into Six Senses Laamu.  We'd spent some days in Dubai and we consequently arrived into Male airport on the 'Emirates red eye' feeling tired. The sheets of early monsoon rain racing across the airport did little to improve our mood. On clearing immigration we were greeted by attentive. uniformed Six Senses staff, who whisked us off to internal departures, booked us in,‚Ä¶"
"What follows is a review I wrote over a period of about 10 days...   Why did we go? Part of the reason we were on Six Senses Laamu was for work as my wife is in the travel business. And, we wanted to renew our wedding vows! It's nice to want to get marry your wife again! :)  Transfers We took a domestic flight from Male. The Six Senses hosts were there at the airport on arrival and departure to smooth out our transfers. The domestic flight passed easily enough... I slept! When we arrived at the local airport near Six Senses Laamu the hosts were there to collect our bags and get us on the speed boat.

The resort was beautiful, our guest experience maker was brilliant. We did have dietary issues, the executive chef seemed to misunderstand vegan vs vegetarian but other than that, our holiday was perfect. It really was indescribably wonderful. "
If you have booked into Six Senses i urge you to start getting very excited as this place is heaven on earth. I will try and give the most honest opinion I can..... Lets start with the very few  Negatives; 1. When we booked Six Senses a long time ago we put in a special request for a sunset view on Jetty A as far out as possible. We received a Villa with a sunrise view not so far out on the jetty at all. Because the resort was almost empty we had hoped for a honeymoon upgrade but this did not happen. However we soon fell in love with our villa and to be honest they are all amazing no matter what jetty or side. It has encouraged us to get up early every morning to watch the sunrise. 2. Rubbish - the local island next door dispose of their rubbish by letting it drift out to sea.‚Ä¶
"This is a wonderful place, great beaches, fantastic service and overall a top top resort.  We went for 10 days i february (2 adults and a baby), and stayed in one of the beach villas.  I can recomend beach villas because of their secluded location and private beaches.  Traveling with a 10 month old baby this was the perfect solution for us."
"My Bride (of 20 years) and I spent a week at Six Senses Laamu, and found the location to be surreal if not initially overwhelming. But the real difference for us was the staff, particularly the wait staff at Longitude Restaurant. They made us feel as though we were their only focus. Quietly spoken, gentle natured staff really suited us and our Holiday. Although a tropical storm went through on the day of our departure, meaning that we missed flights and connections, a staff member from the resort was on hand at the International Airport to assist with re-scheduling all of our flights. Where else would you get that kind of service? As far as the general service at the resort goes, I think that Australian operators could learn a lot from the staff at Six Senses and Maldives in‚Ä¶"
"This was our 2nd Maldives holiday and we had done quite a lot of research with the help of the ever patient Jo at Maldives Direct (also now known as Angelfish Travel) to make sure that we chose an island that would suit us. Well - what can I say - it really couldn't have been more perfect. The transfer from Male was very straightforward and we waited in the Six Senses lounge for less than an hour for our internal flight. This was followed by a short (but fairly bumpy) speedboat transfer. Shoes were placed in bags and we were warmly greeted by the team and our GEM. A quick tour of the overwater area and we were shown to our water villa on Jetty A (sunrise side). The villa was beautiful, the design was certainly very well thought out and we loved the outdoor areas. I still miss‚Ä¶"
"My husband and I spend 7 amazing nights at the Six Senses Laamu for our honeymoon in October 2013. Although it takes a little longer to travel too (short internal flight & speedboat) it is well worth the travel! We stayed with a full board package and loved the variety of foods available. Out favourite was leaf restaurant, with the beautiful fresh organic foods available. A highlight of our trip was a private dinner with matched wines held in the resorts extensive wine cellar.  The unlimited access to the ice cream bar and deli that was included in our package was also such a treat!!  We loved every minute of our stay here, it is such a beautiful place and we have already decided to come back for our 10 year wedding anniversary! "
"We just spent 7 nights at the resort - great everything!  Starts with a smile and an invite to go barefoot and gets better from there.  Our bags went missing for 2 days and we were provided with a survival kit, which was more than sufficient.  The bungalows are luxurious, the inside and outside are flawless and whether you want to laze in the sun or watch the romantic sunset, you will not be disappointed.  For a quiet read there is the upper deck.  Bikes at the bungalows are a nice feature.  The restaurants are great, only complaint is too much food.  The gym is in great shape; my gf recommends yoga and pilates and the spa treatments.  Good snorkelling on the reef: we saw a manta, moray and plenty of sharks and tropical fish.  The equipment at the aquatic centre is sound‚Ä¶"
"Have just returned from our 8 night honeymoon at Six Senses & cannot recommend it highly enough! I can only describe the resort as a well oiled machine, our experience was fantastic and we cannot fault it.  The island is stunning with fantastic facilities and enough to do - even though you cant get sick of lazing on your villa day bed taking in the view.  The water villas are amazing - we had an ocean water villa (45) on jetty b facing jetty c which we loved. Jetty c is far enough away so you can't see anyone opposite. It was also deep enough to jump/dive off whereas a lot of jetty c you couldn't as it was too shallow.  Food was fantastic - the best buffet breakfast we've had. Lunches & dinners were also fantastic with a really good range of food from around the world. Chill bar‚Ä¶"
"When deciding to holiday in the Maldives, our prerequisite was over water bungalow. Six Senses bungalows are amazing, so well appointed and views to die for - we woke up each morning thinking we were in a magazine shoot, the scenery was absolute perfection and that blue water will be etched in our memory for ever.  From the moment we arrived we felt pampered and not just like another guest. We were greeted at 2am in the morning on our arrival by our GEM Lateaf, who looked after all our needs and requests for the week from daily tours and an amazing private dinner on the sandbank for our anniversary to sunburn cures after a day in the sun on our own deserted island.

The very 1st thing, shoes ooooooooof, touching the ground I feel so freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee :-)   Welcome drink on the speed boat is Ginger & Lemon Grass ice tea, and Cinnamon ice tea in my water villa. Definitely the perfect drink to start this whole vacation. Then I couldn't stop to order that every single time when I have my meal in the restaurant.   Remarkable hospitality.

"I stayed in Laamu Six Senses for 7 days for my Honneymoon with my wife and it was the most incredible expirience we could have had. Everything was amazing, the accommodation, the food and mainly the service. The hospitality in particular was wonderful. Our GEM, Auzam, the sommelier, all the guys in the restaurants, the staff in the watersports and in the diving center, everywhere we where very welcomed. Regarding the food our sugestion is to have the Dinne Around half-board. In this way you could try all the diferent restaurants and expiriences. Thank you for making our stay here so ammazing. We felt not in a resort but in a home very very very far away from home."
"Returning to the Maldives, our go to ""get away from it all"" holiday, for the 4th time in as many years, we tried another Six Senses property - Laamu. As a bit of a Six Senses junkie, Laamu did not disappoint. Flying into Male International you have to take another commercial flight to get to the island - but its still worth it. We had an over water villa located in the most private area of the resort right at the end of the jetty, it was amazing being surrounded by only the sea and no neighbours on one side. As regular guests we knew some of the staff and this just added to the amazing family welcome that you get at the six senses properties. Service was beyond excellent! Try the dolphin cruise, even if we were not lucky enough to spot any, the trip is lovely, with bubbles and‚Ä¶"
"Arrival & transfer Unlike many other resorts in the Maldives the transfer to Six Senses Laamu is via a regular domestic flight (rather than a sea plane).  This meant a short walk to the domestic terminal where we were shown to a waiting area adjacent to a small (free) buffet with water and other drinks available.  Unfortunately we had just missed the morning domestic flight so we had to wait about 2 hours for the next flight.  There was a tv showing a kids film which kept our two boys, aged 9 and 11, happy.  The transfer was fine and non-eventful, with us getting off at the first stop (other travellers stayed on the plane which presumably went onto other Maldivian destinations).  We were then met and escorted 250m to the speedboat that was waiting for us.  A lovely 20m speedboat‚Ä¶"
"Just back from the most incredible honeymoon at Six Senses Laamu. We deliberated long and hard about where to go and were worried we'd put all our eggs in one basket and might get bored by just picking one island and in the Maldives too when we like a bit of culture etc. But we were not disappointed. It is true that it is quite a long haul to get there, especially if you don't get a direct flight to Male, but it is so, so worth it and what you get for all that travelling is a remote island with uninterrupted sea views and you truly feel like you are getting away from it all. Not that you will be bored at Six Senses Laamu. That was a worry of ours.

"Husband and I went there in April 2013 and it is hard to tell which part of it we like the best because we love everything there! i love the food from leaf restaurant, watching sunset at Chill Bar and the weekly beach party. the Spa's just excellent! riding bicycle around the island gives us a feeling that we are in vacation! the place is not crowded and it's a good place for honeymoon/anniversary trip!! (for families, I also see a children playroom near beach villas where staff are available playing and taking care of  kids, so may be dads and moms could also have some private time to go diving or snorkeling !)"
"My boyfriend and I stayed at Six Senses Laamu in April. The hotel is an absolute gem! Its luxury at its finest without being unpretentious. Highlights included our water ocean villa on jetty A which was stunning - included all the amenities one could think of - when i had a look at images i was slightly concerned the design would not be up to my taste however the hotel / room / staff / service exceeded my expectations in every way. I woke up to crystal clear water everyday an amazing buffet breakfast (normally not a fan of buffets, but this is definitely luxury and high end)  The spa and gym could not be better i would say its one of the best hotel gyms I have ever been to.   There is no better place to work out than overlooking a beautiful lagoon and white sandy beach. I would‚Ä¶"
"We just returned from a 5 night/6 day stay at Six Senses Laamu as part of our son's 13th birthday celebration.  We had a fantastic time.  It was so low key - barefeet, comfortable clothing, being in touch with nature, with one another and it was a terrific.  Every night, we would admire the stars.  During the days, we would swim, snorkel and read.  We saw lovely fish under our villa, and especially near the house reef.  We swim with stingrays.  Our son didn't want to come out the water.  We didn't even need a pool.  We were too happy in the ocean.  The buffet breakfasts were the best meals/value of the day.  We were on half board plan, which allowed us $78 towards dinner, exluding beverages AND water.  We would have been better off had we spent $236 towards lunch and dinner AND‚Ä¶"
"This resort is great, it's located in an underdeveloped part of the maldives, which makes it fantastic for diving and R&R. Trademark laid back eco-chic, great villas, where you see the learnings from past developments implemented (e.g. Direct access to the shower from the water) and truly great public spaces,mespecially loving the bar area.   While the prices of the villas are even a bit below comparable resorts, the food pricing is on the expensive side. (But far from the rip-off pricing at Cheval Blanc)  Also getting to the place can take quite long, as you might have a fairly long wait between your scheduled domestic flight and your international flight. If you go just for 3-4 nights (as we did as a layover between Maldives and Dubai), I'd recommend a hotel you can reach by‚Ä¶"
"Just stayed at the resort for 5 nights/6 days last week. It has been a very relaxing holiday. I'll probably highlight a few points below:  1. Getting to the resort - From Male, we took a domestic flight to Kadhdhoo airport (around 40 minutes flight) - On arrival, you will be greeted by the resort representative and guided to 'Sense of Speed' for a 20 minutes speedboat ride to the resort.  At the resort, you will be assigned a GEM (Guest Experience Maker). We had Afra and he made sure that we have everything we needed. Attentive and friendly.  2. Villas We stayed at the Ocean View Villa (Jetty C - No.61). All over water villas are identical. The difference is just the view you get from looking out the deck.  Water Villa overlooking other villas/main facilities (restaurants, etc)‚Ä¶"
"It seems you can go almost anywhere in the Maldives and have a great time due to the beautiful islands creating a natural paradise, but Six Senses Laamu really was exceptional. We stayed for 5 nights and it was one of the best holidays in a Laamu water villa, these are on the end of the jetties so extra private, although all the villas did look private.   Here are the best bits:  -A great atmosphere, the whole resort felt cool and luxurious without being stuffy. -Amazing food and drinks. The breakfast buffet in particular is not to be missed. 3 restaurants or the bar to choose from meant that you don't get bored. -Lovely staff, coming from Dubai where service is lacking and staff and often in inpersonable we really appreciated this. -Amazing spa, one of the most relaxing‚Ä¶"
"After an extensive research, we decided to spend the first week of our honey moon in the six senses laamu. Honestly speaking, we were a little bit reluctant because the resort did not have any pool villas or even a common pool.  Let me tell you this; forget about plunge pools in the Maldives. Do not make it a criteria in your selection process.  Having said that, the whole six senses experience was out standing. It all begins with the resorts bare foot policy all the way to the A class dinning experiences and of course the fabulous room and the service.    Let me tell you about the service, even though  during the 8 days of our stay we were never contacted by the Manager of the resort ( which would have been nice), their staff were extra ordinary. They gave a free upgrade to a‚Ä¶"
"I am not going to re-write everything already added by previous reviewers as each has given a very comprehensive overview of this piece of heaven on earth. I cannot say enough great things about every aspect of this trip. It's true barefoot luxury without the bling. All you need are a few pairs of shorts, couple of t-shirts, swim stuff and that's it. A week was not enough. I just flicked through the thesaurus to add some synonyms for 'amazing' - and here we go: astonishing, astounding, awe-inspiring, awesome, bewildering, breathtaking, exceptional, extraordinary, fabulous, fantastic, glorious, great, heart-stopping, impressive, incredible, magnificent, marvelous, outstanding, overwhelming, phenomenal, remarkable, special, stunning, stupendous, terrific, unimaginable, unique,‚Ä¶"

After a short internal flight and a lovely boat trip, we were greeted by the GM, Marteyne and her team which made us feel incredibly welcome. From the moment we stepped onto the welcome jetty we were completely in awe. After being introduced to our GEM 'Guest Experience Maker', we were escorted to our water villa which completely exceeded expectations. Looking out over the water, we could hardly believe our eyes to be honest! So beautiful that you can't believe it's real. The villa was incredible. Lots of space, a lovely decked outdoor area with big beds that you can sunbathe on, a lovely little‚Ä¶"
"This is the first time I stayed at the Six Senses. Heard this brand name many times and finally can experience why they are so exclusive.  A resort which is very Eco friendly, first thing they asked you to do before stepping into the island is to takeoff your shoes.    Friendly smilies and impeccable service can be find in every corner.  I was told the resort was full house....but you can't really feel it.     Thanks our GEM, Saddam for his service too.  "
"This resort is excessive luxury, beautiful location, impeccable service, great snorkeling, wonderful food and ice cream and so GREAT and so EXPENSIVE that you can just never make up your mind if it was worth that enormous amount of money!  The ambience and the design of the hotel is amazing. They have looked in to every detail of this 3 year old hotel and oh it is so tastefully decorated. All weathered natural wood. This resort seems to be an endless relaxing bed full of big soft cushions. The luxury is almost on the verge on becoming a bit decadent with a two floor tall winecellar on stilts in the middle of the ocean. But we seemed to forget that as we just fell back in soft cushions and enjoyed 42 types of different homemade icecream - all for free!  We stayed 5 nights on‚Ä¶"
"My husband and I came to Six Senses Laamu in October for our honeymoon.  Not only were we picked up at the airport by our GEM and a speed boat, but we were also handed delicious ginger drinks---and that is where the pampering began.  Upon arrival, with our mouths agape, we were greeted by some of the crew who were incredibly friendly.  We then got a tour of the island and were brought to our villa.  The villa---it is more than you could possibly dream of.  Not only was it immaculately clean but the view was unbelievable.  The food on the entire island was five star, including the ""In-Villa Dining.""  The Leaf Restaurant was one of the best restaurants we have ever been to, especially when it serves Vietnamese cuisine for lunch.  We went to the spa every day for massages and were‚Ä¶"
"Admittedly I was a little apprehensive about a trip to the Maldives - in case my husband and I would get restless or the food wouldn't be up to expectations and we would have no where else to go. I needn't have been worried - every aspect of the six senses lamuu was paradise. We are experienced travellers who have stayed in some beautiful places, but the setting of the island was beyond expectations. The quality of the accommodation, food and service is exceptional and it is clear from the design of the island and accommodations that six senses really know how to set the ambience. We stayed in an entry level overwater villa and loved it. From the cafe del mar music being played as we entered the villa, to the hammock suspended over the sea and the outside bathroom with shower‚Ä¶"
"Most tranquil and beautiful place ever. The breakfasts are fabulous and the staff are the friendliest, most helpful people. Food/drink is very expensive on the island, but I guess you pay for top quality and the environment/beauty of the island makes it worthwhile! Love the eco-friendly concept of the hotel, they even have their own organic garden! The island itself is worth it...ocean/white sand beach is stunning. The romantic sunset sailing for two was an amazing experience!"
"I had high hopes for this holiday having waited over a year for the date to arrive and I was not disappointed by the resort (the airline - Emirates - was another story).   Words can hardly describe what a naturally beautiful place Laamu is and the resort is highly sympathetic to the environment.  Stunning views, excellent service, incredibly comfortable and delightful accommodation. I was enchanted. Well, to be honest, it took this city girl a couple of days to settle into ti, but the barefoot ethos and constant smiles and hellos from the staff got me to a happy place as quickly as one could expect. The amazing Breakfast buffet and Ice Cream/Chocolate Shop helped a lot too!  It is very expensive, but as far as I can tell, everywhere in the Maldives is, so just accept that as par‚Ä¶"
We visited the hotel just after it opened and it was just great. A little more young and modern hotel compared to the other places we've been in the Maldives.  Staff we lovely and fun and our bungalow was perfect. Food was sublime... 
"We have stayed in the Maldives several times but Six Senses is the best resort by far we have experienced. Food was wonderful, particularly the Vietnamese restaurant. The attention to Detail in the Villa was great & having our own little GEM looking after us is a great idea. The scuba diving facilities are first rate with good dive sites nearby. We loved the bikes that came with the villa so we could cycle everywhere."
"We have just arrived back from six senses in the maldives - what an outstanding experience and an amazingly high quality resort.   There is absolutely nothing we can think of to suggest to improve this resort.  It is expensive over all but it is our belief you get exactly what you pay for.  The entire experience surpassed our expectations on all levels and we would highly recommend it to anyone.  The resort itself is the beautiful - stylish, trendy, a bit quirky, a silver service Robinson Crusoe island from the bare foot experience to the little bikes with our initials on the back.  We stayed in a water villa on jetty c and it was divine.  Every detail thought about and it was incredibly clean and comfortable.   The dining at six senses was excellent.  The breakfasts were‚Ä¶"
"I recently stayed here for my 40th birthday celebration and I don't think I could have been given a more perfect place to stay. This place was everything that I expected the Maldives to be and more... and from the moment we stepped onto the boat this experience was perfection. We were greeted by the team, provided with fantastic treats to help celebrate my special occasion. The food was fantastic, lots of choice at breakfast and in the main dining areas. The staff at the Six Senses were amazing, especially our G.E.M Auzam, the fitness instructor Elle, Exec Chef Nick and the ladies in the Ice Cream Parlour and Longitude. The setting of this venue is perfect, there is nothing that I can say which would fault this experience. First class and the only place would recommend for‚Ä¶"
"I'm not really into package holidays and spending a week based around a hotel or villa in a commercial holiday destination. I guess I'm more of a seasoned traveller, but I really do enjoy luxury and the fine things in life.  I always read Tripadvisor reviews but I never write them. Sometimes I take them with a pinch of salt as what makes excellent/poor for one person doesn't always for another depending on ones tastes and experiences.  So I thought I would share my tastes and experiences with my first ever TA review & why I prefer Six Senses and why I choose Laamu AND  why it was the perfect 40th bday celebration for us.

"We were there for almost a week in September last year - was a super long awaited trip! A year after our wedding was when we finally had time to go away!  The whole journey was superb - apart from the part when we were leaving.. wasn't sure if it was the weather, or air transfers, or we were just simply too grouchy from having to leave paradise  We stayed in one of the water chalets, no complaints there. One of the reasons we decided to stay there was, I saw an advertised picture on FB - who say it doesn't work!?! - and I was hooked on that place..  Furthermore, the price at Laamu was actually a lot more affordable than other places in Maldives.  Our villa was always cleaned promptly, we could just hop off the deck into the water - although really have a look at marine life, you‚Ä¶"
Six Senses Laamu is close to a paradise. The resort is beautiful and the service matches the natural beauty around. The GEM (Guest Experience Maker) will ensure that you have a smooth experience throughout your stay. The water sports will make you feel close to nature. The island is secluded and therefore all you will hear is the sound of waves. The water bunglows are especially beautiful.   Highly recommended to anyone looking for a beautiful time for themselves.
"With all the choices in the Maldives, it was quite hard to make a final decision for our stay. We finally settled on Six Senses Laamu and it met our expectations and fit the description.  First off, the Maldives is an amazing place to visit, the photos online and in magazines may seem photoshopped but the waters are actually that clear, that turquoise and blue.   Six Senses Laamu is the only resort in the Laamu Atoll which I find is its greatest asset, the journey here may be long for some but it was so worth the 45 min. plane + 20min  speedboat transfer from Male Airport. No other tourists or hotels around and you really feel you are disconnected from civilization. It also means the coral and marine life here is very healthy and not as disturbed, which made for some great‚Ä¶"
"If you ever dream of an island atol with blue on blue skies and sea, pure white coral beaches swaying palm trees and pampared luxury then Six Senses is for you. Some people might balk at paying extra for food and drink in an ever more popular all inclusive environment but Six Senses keeps the riff raff out by charging for meals and drinks and why not the food is superb and there are plenty of complimentary things on offer like the amazing 38 flavours of the icecream bar all made on the premises. I truly think we found a paradise and its hard to say that these days. Our room on stilts over the lagoon had a glass floored  bath and loo. The appointments in the room wanted for nothing and the view from our bed was truly breathtaking. Six Senses. It awakens all of them. Try it you‚Ä¶"
"Our Family decided to spend Christmas in a warmer climate than here in Norway, and after some research decision fell on Six Senses Laamu. We were 20 persons; my four children with spouses and their altogether 11 children of ages between 20 to 4, and myself ""Granny"". The long travel of almost 22 hours were forgotten the moment we landed on  the Arrival Jetty and were told to remove our shoes!   From that moment we were in the middle of paradise, and during our almost two week stay there was nothing that could destroy that wonderful feeling of peace,enjoyment and pleasure!!

The view from the terrace is breath-taking! Main facilities are within 3 minute ride from Jetty C (the road is well-kept, but definitely requires better lighting). All restaurants deserve visiting.

"My wife and I were fortunate enough to travel to the Maldives in January 2014. I would have to say that I would have invested hours and hours researching other islands and resorts to make sure I was making the right choice. After speaking to my agent, I finally decided on Six Senses Laamu for the Robinson Crusoe experience and because it was the only hotel in the atoll which my wife and I really wanted to experience.  Laamu blew us away and we could not have been happier with our choice.  Transfers- we were met outside the gate by a Six Senses Rep and taken to the lounge and offered, tea, coffee and food. The rep then proceeded to organize our domestic check in whilst we lounged about for the next hour or so. A lounge attendant then collected us 10 mins prior to the flight‚Ä¶"
"Our family (including 2 children, age 6 and 8 yrs) spent one week at Six Senses, Lamuu, in December 2013. The occasion was to celebrate a special birthday and - although we wanted the kids to have fun - our 1st priority was not to have a children-minded hotel. Instead the idea was to show them how to swim and snorkle on a reef - not in a pool - and for the adults to dive together again -  since it had been 10 yrs.   The hotel was truly amazing - it really just SO lived up to our expectations!  Not only was the water villa we stayed in exceptional beautiful an comfortable. The food and the overall service was execellent! Regarding the kids, one of which is more than challenging regarding food, the staff really did (much) more that we could expect to keep them happy!

"We stayed for 9 days in a water villa at Laamu. This is our second time to the Maldives having stayed at Six Senses closer to Male. This  place is paradise! Great snorkelling off the reef, great food, dolphins passing by the restaurant daily, beautiful accommodation and above all else amazing service! I was 6.5months pregnant and we told the resort in advance - everyone was made aware to ensure my food was safe, the speedboats slow etc etc - just unbelievable service.  Yes it is some what of a journey but well and truly worth it if you want the feeling of being far from the crowd and in true paradise."
"This is our first 5 star stay, usually opting for more rustic or indigenous accommodations. While missing being immersed in the local culture, the trade off for pampered luxury was worth it. Great food, attentive and friendly staff. Beautiful surroundings, and an overall feeling of wellness and happiness amongst the employees and guests alike. From the shoe free policy to bikes at your villa, much of it was a reminder how taking it simple can be so relaxing.   We had a few days of rain that dampened a few spirits, but it also opened up a couple of interesting alternative activities. One was a facilities tour by the resort engineer that was very enlightening. How the resort uses a desalination system for all their water needs down to how they run the herb and vegetable gardens,‚Ä¶"
Arrived at Male airport at 1030 pm and was met by the representative from Six Senses who brought us to the domestic terminal to catch a flight of 45 min to Kadhdhoo airport followed by a 20 minute speed boat ride to the resort.  Took off our shoes on arrival and never put them on again until we left 5 days later ! On arrival we were greeted by our GEMs Ariff who led us to our water villa. We had arrived past midnight and the hotel had prepared some sandwiches for us to snack to which was a nice touch. We awoke to blues skies and clear waters which we took advantage off over the next few days.  We spent most days diving both in and outside the atoll with the highlight diving the channels north of the resort on a full day dive trip. There is plenty of fish to see as well as‚Ä¶
"Like many other travelers the final choice for THE resort to book was a very difficult one however as soon as i saw the photos of Six Senses Laamu i literally couldn't stop thinking about it. Also, we were in doubt about the Maldives, although it is such a dreamy, paradise  destination we thought we will get bored after 2 days as all our holidays were very active and always on the move.  We were very excited to book it for our honeymoon and for 2-3 months before our trip i was checking daily the new reviews and photos of the other guests. However I will never forget the moments and the feelings we had as we were approaching the island with the speedboat and we simply couldn't believe we are there and couldn't believe that place actually exists and not even that, but even more‚Ä¶"
"In our minds the Maldives has always been one vacation destination that we've dreamt of. Our dream was fulfilled in every way. I went with my 18yo daughter as an end of year 12 celebration. From Australia it was rather a long haul, but worth every minute in the end.   The weather in the first few days was sublime, picture book perfect. And that aqua water... oh my God. It was out of this world... beautiful. Then a cyclone formed off India and the wind blew and the rain fell. But, hey, you can't control it. So we made the best of being in paradise.

"A holiday to the Maldives is often a 'once in a lifetime' experience. However, having honeymooned at Soneva Fushi in 1998, we always promised ourselves a return on a special anniversary. The years rolled by and every time we considered it, we decided that there were other things we should be spending our money on. However, at 15 years, we finally decided we deserved our overdue Maldivian fix! A niggling desire for a new experience, and the expense of Soneva Fushi led us to consider, and reconsider, all the other 5 star resorts that had since opened.   We had spent our 2nd week of honeymoon at the Four Seasons, Kuda Huraa, and although we loved the water villa, we preferred the 'Robinson Crusoe' vibe of Soneva Fushi and finally decided that Six Senses would deliver that; echoes‚Ä¶"

"My wife and I stayed at the Six Senses Laamu in April.  Although it is quite a trek getting to the resort, it was worth it.  When we arrived in Male, we were greeted by staff from the resort.  The staff member assisted us with check in to our domestic flight.  After a short hop to Laamu and boat ride, we were welcomed to the resort by management, and introduced to our Gem.  Initially, for privacy,  we had hoped to be on Jetty C, but were advised we'd be staying at the end of Jetty A.  Our Gem assured us we'd like the villa.  He was right, it was awesome!!

We loved the bicycles and I loved the tricycle they gave me to cart my son around in. He enjoyed The Den, and we enjoyed kayaking around the island and snorkeling. And of course everyone enjoyed the free ice cream! The food is very decent (taste and price-wise), especially at Chill Bar. DJ Gary at Chill Bar was also fantastic!

"Picking a place in the Maldives was hard. The price and the fact that once you commit you're essentially trapped made choosing a place really hard.   I'm writing this review from an obnoxiously expensive business hotel in Singapore, and while I appreciate the different operating costs and all that, it really puts into perspective the value I felt I got for the money. I can honestly say that Six Senses knocked it out of the park. I really felt that the service, food and accommodation were fantastic. I guess I'm making this point because we've lived in Southeast Asia for a while and always avoided the Maldives as a vacation spot because we assumed it was not worth the money. I'll keep it simple and say this, I hate traveling and feeling trapped in a resort. I know some people love‚Ä¶"
"We did a lot of research on resorts in Maldives and after much debate set our hearts on Six Senses Laamu. Oh boy was it a great choice! The resort is absolutely amazing. We had the best vacation ever (and we've been to Hawaii numerous times). The weather was gorgeous and it rained only once for an hour or so, which actually was quite cool to experience. We stay in an overwater villa on Jetty A. We asked for the sunset side  and we got it. Uninterrupted views of the ocean and breathtaking sunsets. To be honest though the sky is amazing from pretty much anywhere on the island. Jetty A provides an easy access to the house reef and we snorkeled 2-3 times a day every day. We saw ridiculous amounts of fish, turtles, eagle rays, stingrays, octopuses and baby sharks. Outdoor shower is‚Ä¶"
"My husband and I had an amazing experience with Six Senses Laamu during our stay in November, 2013. Although Soneva Fushi Six Senses Resort is a bit fancier, more chic and organised, Laamu is less expensive and still is one of the best hotels in Maldives I've stayed in.  There are lots of very private areas on the island as well as more social rooms too. Our beach villa was spectacular! Most of the restaurants and bars are located on water in the same place, the only onshore restaurant is an organic one, located very close to the rest. There is a free ice-cream bar and you can enjoy more than 44 types of ice-cream as much as you like. Good training programs, lots of activities, everybody was very friendly.

Everything was perfect from the airport transfer service to the food and accommodation to the final goodbye.   We particularly loved riding our bikes everywhere and the no shoe policy (you can of course wear shoes if you wish, but guests are encouraged to embrace their relaxed approach to luxury-fine by us!). I actually wish I had know about this 'policy' beforehand as I wouldn't have packed those 4 pairs of shoes...People dress very casually and their are no 'fancy' restaurants on the island so you can get by perfectly well with a few beach dresses and shorts and t-shirts.

This is a must go destination. No complaints"
"We just got back yesterday from a 6 day/night stay at the Six Senses Laamu and everything about our visit was amazing. This was our first trip to the Maldives and before we booked/went I have to admit that for me, the price tag was a bit daunting. I was like ""wow, that's an expensive trip to go on...""... but now that I have been there my thought regarding price is ""wow, i can't believe we were able to experience all of that for such a low price""...  Really even when you consider that most of the food items appear on first glance to be expensive (or perhaps VERY expensive) you then should realize how much effort goes into growing the on-island garden vegetables and herbs, boating in all the other necessities, etc. They really are creating a wonderful top notch dining experience‚Ä¶"
"we spent our honeymoon there and we loved it! Everything was just perfect. The arrival, the facilities, the staff, the food and the overwater bungalows (!) - very luxurous but still with a nature twist making it fitting into the environment. In general we loved the relaxed luxury style and very chilling atmosphere (no shoes, barefoot all the time, relax dress code at restaurants)you can find at Six Senses Laamu. Everyone gets a bike to drive through the island, this was great. We enjoyed that very much. The entire reception & restaurants area are overwater, this is very unique, wonderful and rarely seen at other resorts.

"When you get in the boat to Six Senses they give you a bag to put your shoes. This is a Robinson Crusoe type of luxury hotel. I liked that.  The hotel is in a very small island of no more than 700m with around 200 guests tops and at least 300 employees. When you arrive you are assigned a GEM (Guest Experience Maker) who will assist you everyday for anything at anytime.  The Lagoon water villas have a Bose sound system and we asked for an iPhone 5 adaptor and he even let us a iPod classic with tons of chill out music (the music we wanted).  Food is excellent and service is out of the ordinary.  I recommend the lobster dinner on the beach, the dolphin trip and diving.

Villa: We had awesome experience with reservation team, who tried their best to meet our ocean  villa preference. We stayed in west facing ocean water villa in jetty A. It was a good overall package of privacy, snorkeling, sun light thought day and distance to resort facilities. Basically, we had exactly the villa we hoped and could not ask more as seasoned luxury travelers. A big thank you to the reservation team.  Our room boy is the best we ever had in all 5star hotels throughout world. We tipped him (in the end of stay) truly because the consistent, great‚Ä¶"
"Had the most amazing first part of our Honeymoon at six senses last year (November 2012).  Position of our over water bungalow a little further away than we had hoped for, considering we booked 12 months prior to our arrival and we had requested a closer jetty to the main amenities, though at check in we were told we didn‚Äôt get our preferred selection. Shortly after we realised that our jetty was a little far but more private. Try not to arrive at night, we did and regret it as you not only loose a day but flying over the Maldives and taking the boat during the day would have been fantastic to witness.  The bungalow is what you would expect and more. We both were quite speechless and amazed at how we were not looking at a travel brochure and we really were in this beautiful‚Ä¶"
"Let's be clear right from the start:  Six Senses Laamu is the most perfect hotel anywhere!  If you are reading this, you are perhaps considering the holiday of a lifetime in The Maldives; but which hotel to choose?  They all seem so similar!  Upon arrival at Male International terminal, you are met by a Six Senses representative who will take you and your luggage to the domestic terminal for the 30 minute flight to an airstrip close to the resort.  From there it's a 20 minute speedboat ride.  Just be aware that the local flights are often rerouted for no apparent reason - our 30 min flight took 2 hours and that on top so a 90 min delay:  Very trying!  Not to worry.  The moment you arrive you know you are somewhere very special.  A WaterWorld in the Indian Ocean.  After being‚Ä¶"
"From the moment of our arrival we knew that would be more then just a great vacation, and we were right! We stay there 6 nights with full board (at the begining of October). The whole stuff including our GEM (Masrhooq) were really friendly and nice, and they took care of our needs just perfectly. Food was delicious, might next time we would take just half board cause you have 3 course meal and breakfast were gigantic, but on other side we tried a lot of different type of food. True is that beverage is expensive, small beer cost 8$ (without 18% tax), there is a 10% tax for service and 8% maldives tax, I would pay that amount for large beer but not for a small one, The same is with the wine and coctails, and spa were way expensive, but if you go to Maldives you have to count with‚Ä¶"
"Me and my family was in Laamu this September. It was in the middle of monsoon, but we were lucky to have full sunshine everyday. Yes, bit of rain from a passing by cloud. Didn't bother us much. Excellent service and friendly staff. Always ready to assist.  Loved the breakfast buffet and Ice cream house. BTW, who serves free ice creams throughout the day other than Six Senses Laamu? Was loving it. I have traveled a lot, but never was satisfied as much as i was when i am in the care of Six Senses. Love the company.  We were staying in a over-water bungalow. Facilities and amenities available are endless. In the mini bar, you can have free hot chocolate, finest quality tea, grounded coffee with a plunger, nuts and still and sparkling water. Even have a Nespresso machine with coffee‚Ä¶"
"I went here in late October 2013, and it was more disappointing than anything. I would not recommend to go here.  PROS: The island is visually stunning.  The over-water villas are also beautiful and make for amazing pictures.  The weather is always somewhere between 25-35 degrees (Celsius).  The staff is friendly despite the language barriers of most.  The snorkeling is awesome.  The spa was also fantastic! We got Oriental Massages and my wife got a coconut wrap which were brilliant!  By the way, they have spa deals if you book within 48 hours of arriving.  CONS: There isn't the value for the money here.  In this price range you should be able to find TONS of other resorts that do a much better job.  First of all, the food situation here is terrible!  We tried many times to‚Ä¶"
"We have just returned from a 5 days trip to Six Senses Laamu atoll in the Maldives. It is difficult to find words that can express the beauty and exquisite service we received on this trip. The trip contained pure luxury from beginning to end. The staff, with no exceptions, were wonderful people. They all seem to have only one thought in their mind, how can we make the guests' visit as comfortable as possible? They certainly knew the answer! Our GEM sometimes even knew what we wanted before we did!  If you are looking for a trip to really relax and enjoy good food, clean and beautiful nature, a relaxing atmosphere you can probably not find a better place than this.    I found no issues to point at that was negative, so in deed, have you found this place, you do not need to‚Ä¶"
"Before deciding where to return to the Maldives for the 4th time, we searched out resorts with a difference.  Being in the southern Atoll with fewer resorts, Six Senses Laamu offered a number of key attractions: more isolated, wide range of activities including surfing, generous water villas and variety of amenities.  For seasoned Maldives visitors, we were still completely bowled over.  The island is beautiful, well-thought out, meticulously planned and natural.  We spotted turtles, rays and (small) sharks in the reef outside our amazing villa (Jetty A, no. 17).  We rowed to a local sandbank to see the cleanest sand and water in the world.  We went night-snorkelling on the house reef with torches and hired a boat to go to the best local reefs and swim with turtles.  F&B was‚Ä¶"
"My wife and I booked this amazing trip to Six Senses Laamu after reading a lot of reviews on TA. We weren't disappointed. Great staff that always go out of your way to help, sensational food, we felt that we were the only ones on the atoll even though it was fully booked. Ocean dimensions diving was good to dive with. very safe and willing to make your experience extra special. Thanks SS. Stuart and Belinda."
"Having been to dozens of other islands in the Maldives, it is rare that an island completely exceeds my expectations. Six Senses Laamu is a resort I have been interested in since its opening, but I never booked because of various concerning elements past travelers have reported in their reviews. I am glad i finally visited because many of those concerns were unwarranted. It is not perfect (no island is), but several elements of the resort are the best I've seen among all the other islands I've visited in the Maldives.  Accommodations: The villas are simply beautiful. Very rustic with a real Robinson Crusoe atmosphere throughout. They may not be the largest or most luxurious in the Maldives, but they are very spacious and well designed. If you've ever stayed at Soneva Fushi, the‚Ä¶"
"Our honeymoon at Six Senses Laamu exceeded my expectations. My spouse and I went to Maldives for our honeymoon but also, we wanted to learn to dive. This was our first time diving and we were really excited!   When we arrived at Six Senses, we visited the Ocean Dimensions dive center right away. We enrolled in the PADI Scuba Diver course and our instructor was Harvey Edwards. Harvey was knowledgeable, skillful and most importantly, passionate. I am not going to lie, the first few dives were a little bit of a challenge (especially trying to practice buoyancy control with congested sinuses!) but with much patience and understanding from Harvey, I was able to push through and had a blast. I never would have imagined that I would have found such a wonderful instructor - in every way‚Ä¶"
"We spent 14 wonderful days at Six Senses Laamu in September. 14 days with sun and only 2 hours with rain, considering this is the monsoon time we were positively surprised! The place was just beyond imagination, really an excellent luxury five star Robinson Crusoe experience in the most turquoise water! Yes it is pricy, but hey, it is a five star luxury resort in the Maldives, what did you expect? We definitely will recommend this place, especially to couples.   The Island: The resort is situated on a relatively small Robinson Crusoe style island, only 750m x 200m. In fact you keep wondering how they can keep all necessary infrastructure on such a limited space without it being visible? However, it feels so much bigger and you can easily find private spots along the beach side.‚Ä¶"
"I've been in Maldives with my buddies and stayed in Six Senses Laamu for 5 nights.I've ever stayed in some Six Senses resorts like Six Senses Samui, Six Senses Hua Hin (No longer operated by Six Senses), Evason Hua Hin and Six Senses Yao Noi. And I feel that Six Senses resort always keep their commitment in green, eco-friendly and sustainability concepts.My Lagoon water villa is really nice, chic and eco-friendly.I love the sunken glass bathtub, a private water garden and the dining deck facing towards the turquoise lagoon.The resort also provided bicycles in guest villa for riding and exploring the entire island.Breakfasts in Longtitude restaurant was really nice but not excellent.They served a variety of organic fresh food and the atmosphere here was very incredible.The resort‚Ä¶"
"Our honeymoon at Six Senses Laamu was even better than we had imagined.  No detail is overlooked, and the service is beyond perfect.  My wife and I spent 12 days in paradise at this resort and could have easily spent a month here!  Service Never in my life have I experienced better service than this.  Your GEM (guest experience maker) is your personal host for your stay, and are incredibly accommodating. Our GEM Regina was beyond our expectation.  She was so friendly and always helping us plan the perfect day.  She organized many nice touches for us being that it was our honeymoon and scheduled wonderful excursions for us, many which were complementary! No matter what the request, Regina was there to deliver.  A truly unbelievable experience.  Everyone at the restaurants were‚Ä¶"
"My husband is always dying to go to Maldives and we finally decided this is the place for honeymoon. We only stayed there for 4 nights but we will never forget these 4 days! Everywhere in this island is breathtaking! The food was good, not the best but still delicious. The staffs all deserved two thumbs up! The room was clean twice a day and when you request something they always show up almost right away! It's hard to find anything to criticize. Well, maybe I should say one thing, you need to save enough for this place as the package is really pricy but it just worth every penny. We are hoping to save enough to go again in 10 years! Thanks for making our honeymoon so remarkable!"
"We have just returned from a magical holiday at this resort and would highly recommed it. We have been to this resort three times and stayed in a beach villa each time and it is fantastic. The island is beautiful, the architecture is stunning, and overall it is exclusive yet relaxed. The food is fresh and delicious. The staff are all brilliant, efficient and super friendly. And if all that is not enough, the resort has an outstanding environmental philosophy which ensures protection and sustainability. We loved our holiday at this resort, treasure our memories and beautiful photos and cannot wait to go back!"
An amazing hotel located in a wonderful destination that you can reach after an internal flight of 45mn (if plane is on time or if it doesn't make any special route). Careful with the waiting time from Male airport. The rooms are incredibles especially the water villas and it is the perfect destination for a honeymoon. The spa is excellent and one of the most gorgeous I've seen.
"I went to this resort in August to celebrate my husband's birthday. Service was good and there was a warm welcome upon our arrival. In general I love the resort and I can see sunrise from my villa every day.  I booked the ocean water villa and I'm more than happy with it. I have thought of booking the laamu water villa and the beginning but decided to choose ocean water villa as it's much cheaper with half board. At the end, I think this is a wise decision. Ocean water villa is already very quiet with nice views.  I love the idea of swimming in the sea. I trust this is the best natural ""swimming pool"" and I do think there is no need to have another swimming pool when the sea is the best place to go. Water is clear with lots of corals and fish around.  Since Maldives resorts‚Ä¶"
"We enjoyed a magical week here. Six Senses Laamu is a stunning resort, incredibly designed and with excellent service. The staff are so friendly and thoughtful and really look after you. For us what makes this resort different is that it is 5 star luxury with a genuinely relaxed and friendly atmosphere. Something that can be difficult to achieve, we have found, but Six Senses do it perfectly. The vibe is so relaxing and the natural (and stunning) architecture of the resort is breathtaking. We have holidayed at several different Six Senses hotels and they always deliver. Come here if you are looking for pure escapism, pampering and ultimate relaxation!"
"We stayed at six senses for our honeymoon in September and it was one of the best experiences of our life. The Maldives is one of those places that everyone should try visit in their lifetime, and it was made all the more special by the Six Senses Laamu Resort.   Villa We stayed in an overwater villa on Jetty C. I definitely recommend Jetty C as opposed to the others as it had the most privacy and was furthest away from the main resort area. The villas are spacious, clean and well-appointed with amazing views of the turquoise, crystal clear water.  We barely wanted to leave the villa as we were able to lounge in the sun and snorkel and swim right off our balcony while listening to music from our room. The room also has a TV that you can watch either from the bedroom or while you‚Ä¶"
"We stayed here on our honeymoon in July 2013. We stayed in a Laamu water villa on jetty A. Overall, we had a wonderful time and would easily recommend it. The villa itself was excellent and the island is beautiful. We enjoyed snorkelling, the beach, kayaking and diving. We also visited the gym, which has a great view, and the SPA. The setting of the spa was wonderful. However, the treatment I had there (massage) was average, and overpriced.  The food was mostly very good. We particularly enjoyed the Leaf restaurant at lunch time (vietnamese) and the breakfast buffet, with lots of fresh fruit and juices.  Room service was ok, but the standard of the food was not quite up to the restaurants. The bar had a great selection and well made cocktails.  We did encounter one major problem‚Ä¶"
"Amazing place, excellent service, the spa is like a dream, real massages and pampering. Highly recommended not only for honey moons. I actually could go back on my own.  They have a jungle cinema which plays all best movies from all times, check it out.. Truly perfect holiday. Also the bar has a Dj playing amazing chill out tunes. The Japanese restaurant the best. "
"A very good hotel indeed. A little bit too far away from the international airport so think if you are going for just a week (like we did) but we think the trip is worth it.  There has been a lot said about the place so we can only confirm that both the beach villas and the water villas (we stayed in the top one on jetty B) are of a very good quality, although we preferred the water ones for more privacy and the wow factor plus no mosquitos as a bonus:).  A small drawback if you are staying in a beach villa is that although there is a nice line of sand to sunbath, it's not the best to swim in really. But a short walk gets you to the spa beach which we liked a lot.  We don't see any problem in staying on jetty B or C at all we would even opt for not being on jetty A as it has‚Ä¶"
"I consider my husband and I experienced travelers, we have been over 40 countries with different ranges of budget - but this place was definitely the most beautiful we've ever been to. Everything here is perfect. The villas are beautiful and yet very integrated with the nature. The food is delicious. The spa is lovely. The island is peace itself and the staff is amazing - every single detail is thought beforehand - from the bikes they park in front of your villa to the music and CD they leave playing in the rooms. In addition, they try to offer all products organic, including after sun shampoo and conditioner and other treats. I'd definitely recommend it for anyone who wish to visit Maldives!!"
"My husband and I picked this resort for our honeymoon earlier this year. Our entire experience of staying at this Six Senses property was absolutely superb!  We were welcomed by the staff in a very warm manner and were made comfortable from the minute we stepped foot there. Our personal GEM (Guest Experience Manager) helped us plan our activities and experiences throughout our stay there. The resort itself has a very 'island' and 'nature' feel to it, which was what we were looking out for. We were provided with two bicycles to move easily around the island which was very enjoyable!  Our water villa was gorgeous, completely wooden, beautiful patio, interesting bathroom amenities, cute minibar, glass bathtub, cosy terrace etc. We could probably spend all day just lazing in the‚Ä¶"
"We stayed at Six Senses Laamu back in March and I am already dreaming of going back. It is a little harder to get to but so worth it.  Room We had booked a Lagoon Water Villa and had requested Jetty B on the sunset side. This request was granted no problem and we may have been upgraded as were close to the end of the Jetty. Jetty B has the beautiful turquoise water during the day and isnt too far from the main area but still private. Room itself was huge and loved the novalty of the glass floor in the toilet for our first Maldives experience. We loved spending the whole day on the deck, shifting between the couch and lounge chairs with the large glass doors open to allow us to hear the music from the sound system. We could stare at the beautiful water all day.  Food Yes it was‚Ä¶"
This place was a dream come true for our honeymoon. Our ocean villa on Jetty C (the most peaceful) was perfect. The service was amazing and the attention to detail was perfect. Our only shock was the additional cost of everything but that was probably just our naivety.
"I've traveled extensively both on work assignments but also on vacations. I had never been to the Maldives before but i have stayed at many 5 star resorts at amazing locations around the world, so the WOW effect of simply a beautiful location as the Maldives was something that would not work with me. And all I can say about this hotel is positive, i really loved the place. The island is beautiful and they've done a great job to seamlessly integrate the resort in a pristine natural environment. We stayed at a beach villa which was very spacious , amazing shower, and beautiful sandy beach. There are not many beach villas and they have a generous separation from the neighbouring villas, so you really feel you have your own private beach to yourself most of the time, you rarely see‚Ä¶"
"We stayed at Six Senses Laamu almost a year ago and I'm wishing that I could go back! The water villas were great, the food was delicious and the staff were friendly. I enjoyed that we could bike to get to where we wanted to go. Plus we had fun doing yoga as a family. I would definitely recommend this place!   Also check out more pictures on my blog: misscuriouslyhungry.blogspot.com"
"After the recent trip to Maldives and look back to all the 9 resorts I've stayed, I am now able to confirm Six Senses Lammu was my best stay so far. I took some time to organize photos (out of couple thousands) for this post, they tell how good Laamu is.  I feel I did not give a fair justice to my previous review on Laamu for rating 4 points only, but the last review are having more detail information about my stay:  http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g2050017-d2045398-r130717288-Six_Senses_Laamu-Olhuveli_Island.html"
"My wife and I spent 5 nights here on our honeymoon and have to say everything is just as the pictures show it. 5 nights was enough however we could have spent much more time here easily. All the staff were awesome, standout staff were Ali our GEM and Oscar the sommelier, who served us for our wine dinner and cheese tasting experiences has to be commended for his service and friendliness throughout our stay. It has taken almost 2 months to write this post as I couldn't and still can't explain how great our experience was during our stay. Not a bad word can be said about our experience apart from one of the dive staff who was a little abrupt and unfriendly, however everyone else was awesome. The staff must say hello about 1000 times a day to guests but keep On smiling and making‚Ä¶"
"This place is amazing, took quite a bit to get to but well Wirth the trip. The food could be better, but the resort and surroundings made up for everything. We stayed in an overwater bungalow thing. And easily it's the best place I've been to. Ask the staff to make you some local food it's very nice. The spa was great, which you would expect from a six senses."
"Arranged for honeymoon in Low season end May/Beginning June. Weather was perfect (note the weather is not guaranteed obviously and we had simply good luck, a couple of weeks prior to our arrival it rained every day for a fortnight apparently) You take the chance and you make the decision. I don't get the people who complain ? Destination perfect ! The staff are warm, friendly, efficient and nothing is too much trouble. We found the food to be varied, tasty and plenty. Only point to mention is the cost of drink, It is not cheap and does add up by the end of your stay. The facilities are good with plenty to do. Obviously it helps if you enjoy water ! The Villas on the jetties are amazing, i would opt for 'C' if you want total solitude. The dive school is recommended. As is the‚Ä¶"
"A couple once told me they wouldn‚Äôt choose Maldives for their honeymoon because they were both active people, and the Maldivian concept would bore them. They couldn‚Äôt be more wrong.  My husband and I spent two weeks in paradise, also known as Six Senses Laamu. During this time, we certified ourselves as PADI Open Water scuba divers, got married, took a cooking class, joined wine tasting, a dolphin cruise, snorkeled, played volleyball with the staff, and tried lots of new foods and drinks. We had the best two weeks of our lives, and would highly recommend this amazing resort. We only have one single complaint: the knives! They should really considering getting knives that are sharp enough to cut through your food ;)  In the following I would like to highlight a few of our‚Ä¶"
"My husband and I stayed at Six Senses Laamu for a week in June.  This is the low season, but we've been to the Maldives previously in June and the weather has always been great.  We were really impressed by the resort, the laid back vibe is fantastic and the decor in the manages to balance being modern, comfortable and stylish whilst having a very 'eco' vibe (eg: top of the range bose sound systems in wooden water villas... you get the idea).  We satayed in an ocean villa, which was very spacious with a huge balcony, roof deck and outdoor bathroom.  Really you could spend all day at the villa as there were enough spaces to move around.  The ocean villas are a little more expensive than the lagoon villas despite being the exact same layout - although when we arrived we weren't‚Ä¶"
"If you have ever visited Six Senses Fushi or Gili (now sold-off), you will understand where I'm coming from... Don't get me wrong, this is a beautiful island with that 'jungle' feeling and rustic chic luxury of the water villas. Who can ever tire from riding a bike to breakfast and dinner (wearing an evening dress!). However, my disappointment began when the 'no news, no shoes' philosophy wasn't introduced during the transfer to the island (although am sure I did see someone with a shoe bag later in the week). We had a arrived late with another couple and our GEM spent little time welcoming us and showing us round our accommodation. Fortunately, the set up of the Six Senses accommodation in the Maldives is similar and we were able to work things out for ourselves. In general our‚Ä¶"
"Six Sense Laamu was an amazing experience for us. We had a lovely honeymoon. Our lagoon water villa was immense, such amazing views! The staff were incredible and very helpful. The resort had thought of almost everything, from raincoats to torches to sun screen. We had nothing to complain about. They had even added in small touches as we were honeymooning. We were full board, so we were lucky, otherwise food is expensive. We will definitely going back at some point!"
"We decided to try the cliche honeymoon and opted for an over the water bungalow in the Maldives, needless to say everything was impeccable and even though our expectations were high, they were well met, and on the majority of occasions the experience well exceeded them.  We travelled from Australia, with various connecting flights and time in the air, neither my wife and I are avid flighers, so upon our arrival (somewhat dischevelled) we were welcome and greeted in a comfortable but professional manner, which instantly eased us into a relaxed holiday mode. ou GEM (Guest experience maker) at the Six Senses went above and beyond to make sure our trip was comfortable and had no hesitation in providing us with the information we required at all times.

"Their rooms are awesome, I could not complain about that. Beautiful views from the room, and you can snorkel right from the room. Bath area is also very nice and unique. My only problem was that food was very expensive. I was lucky to find Chef Ansari, who made us food of our taste and liking. He was very kind and really took a good care of us. I could never forget him for his great hospitability and great food. He made sure that we were not hungry and were always happy with our food. We tried their drinks, and they were average and not very special.   If I were to improve anything here, I would definitely offer food at a much cheaper price. And also have more variety of food and drinks. We had complimentary breakfast with our room, but it was the same breakfast every single‚Ä¶"
"What a great location, staff were amazing and so friendly. The resort is immaculate and we can not fault the service or the location. My only concern was the price of extras on the island. We had a full board stay and the food was delicious. We did two tours, one a 6 hour islands tour and a 2 hour snorkelling tour, for two people that cost us $900 U.S dollars. The cheapest bottle of wine on the island was $45, spirits started at $10 just for the nip then your mixer was an additional $5. Everything you purchase has an additional 10% surcharge which doesn't really make sense and then you have to add the 8% gst. So a spirit ended up costing around $18. Again can not fault the service we had an amazing stay.    We would go back to the Maldives however I don't think I could justify‚Ä¶"
"We chose Six Senses, Laamu for our 2nd Anniversary.  Rate experience? - GOOD but NOT WOW.  Transfers:   From Male Airport - you are transferred onto a 1h flight followed by 30 min boat ride.

Room:  Water Villa  -Neat, clean, well-kept villas   -Amenities were excellent (They have lovely shower amenities which were fantastic from great scented soaps - Lemon Grass, Mint etc)  -Plenty of drinking water in room.

"My wife and I spent just over a week here for our honeymoon in late April. We loved our time in the Maldives, and we would definitely come back not just to the country, but also the Six Senses.  All the airport transfers were arranged by our travel agent (but can also be arranged by the hotel). On arrival into Male we were escorted by staff to a lounge, and then a couple of hours later we were on a flight to another domestic airport, before finally put on a boat for 20 minutes when we finally arrived at the Six Senses. The whole experience was flawless and well rehearsed with some nice touches along the way.  We were met by our GEM and management on arrival, given a tour and escorted to our over water accomodation.

"I visited Laamu in April with my girlfriend and overall we had an extremely relaxing stay and were quite sad to leave. I would say the high points were the location itself, by which I mean the beautiful tropical foliage, the beach and clear waters, fish swimming by your villa, wonderful bike paths, and the lovely Chill Bar with its semi-circular lounge area facing the water and sunset.  Contrary to a previous review I did not feel as if the resort was an overbuilt Waterworld, but maybe this is just because I haven't been to any other Maldives resorts.  You will not see many guests out walking around during the day, which lends a relaxed feel to the place.  It really does allow you to slow down and just enjoy the surroundings.  Beware of walking on the hot wooden decking at‚Ä¶"
"Just arrived back from our holiday at six senses. It was our first time in Maldives and we found our stay there was just not long enough (10 nights).   On arrival to Male airport you will be met by six senses reps who escort you to the lounge to await your next short haul flight. The lounge is great just to freshen up and recharge before you board. After the 40 mins flight you will be met again by another six senses rep then escorted to the speedboat. (it took us roughly 20/25 mins) to the resort.  On arrival at six senses we was met by the management team who welcomed us + we was introduced to our gem properly.

"Reluctantly just arrived back from our perfect honeymoon ! Stayed in an ocean water villa and it was perfect- everything about this place is paradise. And girls, leaves your jimmy choos at home. Dressing up minus shoes really is great!  Came home feeling great after the fabulous food, wine, riding our bikes, relaxing and snorkelling. Didn't get bored once. Food is all fresh, gourmet, no tacky buffets here. Can't believe some people here have moaned about things! Really, writing a review about erosion?? That's just nit picking. Can't understand what you can complain about here.  We are fussy people and we weren't disappointed. Yes it's a long long journey but well worth it :) Book it!"
"I stayed here in January 2012. First time in the Maldives and honest to goodness, what a place. Phenomenal seems like an understatement.  We stayed in the water villas. The entire place is built with wood and is  so  cleverly designed. Loved the glass bathtub and the 'fish TV' in the loo... You'll know what I mean when you are there. The bed and pillows are divine... Its like sleeping in the clouds.  The snorkelling is fabulous. The reef is gorgeous and checking out corals and underwater life is breath taking.   All the staff is lovely..you'll love your GEMs... and the food and drink is just sublime.. Its such an amazing place to get away to.

"My husband and I stayed at Six Senses in November 2012 for our 5th anniversary. We had the best time - the over water villa was stunning, the food beautiful, the staff were amazing and so attentive. We are already deciding which Six Senses property we will visit next based on our week at Laamu!"
"I stayed at Six Senses Laamu in late August of 2012.  Upon arrival I was greeted by Jonanthan, the Hotel Manager.  Jonathan gave us a great tour of the facilities which were exceptionally beautiful.  The overwater room was thoughtfully designed with attention to every detail and luxuriously comfortable.  We were able to snorkle off of the room.  I was traveling with a friend for the first two nights and then was on my own three nights.  As a single person at first it felt like a little too much of a honeymoon but then I actually met some lovely people who invited me to join them for meals and activities so I didn't feel as much like an odd man out.  The food at the resort was delcious and inventive.  Occasionally the staff did not know as much about the menu as I would have‚Ä¶"

We were greeted by our GEM Auzim (not sure if spelled correctly) and he made sure we had a fantastic time. We stayed in an overwater bungalow with amazing views, the room was really well designed with an amazing outdoor bathroom, glass floor in toilet & beautiful deck with uninterrupted views. The only con: there is not much coral life left in front of the bungalow (at least at Jetty C as the hotel is still very new) but it didn't really matter as there is a very nice house reef in front of chill bar, perfect for snorkelling.

Attention to detail in everything!  We stayed at one of the last bungalows on Jetty B, number 45 Ocean Villa. Superb! So quite and the amazing blue waters of the Indian Ocean made us jump out of bed each morning straight into the ocean! The outdoor shower was fantastic! We celebrated our 10th anniversary and renewal of our vows on the sand bank. It was quite an experience! Staff is so friendly it hurts! ;) The food is excellent in all of the restaurants, although not quite a lot of food, since all the restaurants are gourmet, but‚Ä¶"
Our first visit to Maldives and we had quite a high expectation. Unfortunately this place really did fail to deliver. Six senses Laamu is located on a atoll with very limited marine life. Only place that could be considered ok for snokelling is in front of the reef resturant. We had booked an over water ocean villa and had specially requested one of the ones at the end of jetty A facing the left side. However we we allotted a villa facing the right side of Jetty A which was really not much different to a lagoon water Villa.   The service is ok but not quite up to five star standard that you will find from places like Grand Hyatt. TV in the Villa broke down three times during our stay and our GEM Arif had told us one day prior to our departure that since our flight was quite late‚Ä¶
"This resort really delivers the dream of the Maldives. The setting is absolutely gorgeous with long, sandy beaches, chrystal clear, turquoise waters and lush green vegetation. Not only is the strong ecological mission of Six Senses and Evason clearly stated but also seems to be embraced by all the staff at this resort. We experienced that it was a mission lived, really true at heart and well managed!   The different kitchens all serve local foods like the catch of the day (warning, reef fish can be a bit tough), with greens and herbs from their own garden, and you can find restaurants from all corners of the world here. We fell in love with the restaurant ""Leaf"" (on the beach) with its Vietnamese lunch that we came back for over again! The ""Leaf"" restaurant was often empty which‚Ä¶"
"I stayed here in early March 2013.  It's a protracted journey, but worth it, IF you get what is advertised.  On arrival at the resort the Resort Manager greets all visitors and gives a short brief, thereafter you are handed over to your GEM.  Sadly, one of the first things visible on arrival is the EROSION that is evident and clearly detrimental to the first impressions of the resort.  Another reviewer has covered this subject superbly (Feb 2013), please read and digest as this is something that is NOT pictured on the official blurb but is a serious detraction and problem.  I labour this point as a stay at this resort is by no means cheap and I feel selling this island (either by Travel Agent or Operator) without mention of this problem is clearly disingenuous.  Having visited‚Ä¶"
"Was at Chill bar yesterday night and it was a great experience after a rainy wash out. The music selection and all collection by DJ Barel was outstanding, made us to stay right from evening drink till late night dinner. good work DJ Barel."
"My wife and i went to SSL last March and decided that we wanted to return, so we returned for a longer stay this year and have just returned.  As returning guests we were treated even better than our first stay, we were fast-tracked through the check-in procedure and taken straight to the Water Villa, 90% of the staff recognised us as well and it was nice to see them again.  SSL is the perfect place to get away from a busy fast paced Life, where you can lie in the sun and read and if you get too hot jump into the lagoon, and then if you fancy any activities there are plenty to do.  The food was also another reason to return, the price is quite high but the food is of world class standard in each restaurant.  People seem to slate the fact that the resort is in the south and it‚Ä¶"
"I've just stayed 7 nights on OWB 72 on jetty C and overall the stay was excellent. I must say that it wasn't a pure 5 stars rating, trying to nail it here:  The amazing stuff:  a) the service - top notch, you just don't get what you want if you really don't want to (or you just can't afford it). The staff is pure perfection.  b) The villas, the overall slow life concept, the materials used on the island are stunning  c) the outdoor cinema, the food (I strongly recommend the chilli table at Leaf), the star gazing, the spa are a must and give the property that extra special atmosphere  The lows  d) the island is suffering from severe erosion and there are some unpleasant settings where you just think ""this doesn't look promising"" - I wonder how much of this is due to the overwater‚Ä¶"
"This was the 2nd of our 2 resorts that we visited for our honemoon and it just completely blew us away. Much has been written about how amazing the place is and all of it is true. Our trip was not as perfect as we would have liked it to be considering the exhorbitant price. Ill elaborate below.   The perfect part of the trip was the place itself, the ocean water villa, the food, everything. Despite the perfection in almost everything, 3 things deserve special mention:  1. the fabulous music at the Chill bar by Bar'el who made our evenings, unbelievably even more perfect and  2. the photographer that we hired from the resort. She kept us extremely comfortable throughout the photo shoot at the sand bank and the photographs were perfect.  3. the fantastic dolphin cruise at sunset. ‚Ä¶"
"We recently returned from two weeks in a Lagoon Beach Villa at Six Senses Laamu. This was our seventh visit to a 5 star resort in the Maldives.  The holiday was very good, really relaxing, loved the no shoes laid back approach, the island vegetation and the fantastic looking and sandy bottomed lagoon. Snorkelling around the island we saw Turtles, Eagle Ray, Moray Eel, Octopus and large numbers of fish, some quite large although the colour of the corals are muted.  The staff in the resort are great and contributed significantly to our stay with their friendly, happy and efficient manner. I think it helps having local islands where a lot of the families live and the management have obviously built a great team. In particular our GEM Judy, Housekeeping Shamen and especially Chef‚Ä¶"
"Our honeymoon was spent on this fantastic resort - we could not find any faults with this place it was magical.  We were greeted at Male Airport by a representative and were looked after all the way through our holiday.  The transfers to the island went smoothly, the staff were very helpful and friendly and the accommodation was heavenly - overwater villa with views of turquoise water.  The food was 1st class and would advise to take the half board at least so you save some money.  The only problem I had was that I did advise our GEM (Guest Experience Maker) that I had a gluten intolerence and was not catered to for this but I managed to enjoy the food regardless.  We stayed in a villa on Jetty C and really enjoyed the bicycle ride to the main area for meals and also enjoyed the‚Ä¶"
"We were on the Maledives for the first time and picked the SixSense due to its location in the far South of the Maledives (no airplane an little speedboat traffic), the experiences we had in other Soneva-retreats, the size of the island, the guaranteed swimming depth of the lagoon water and that it has a house riff just off the beach. Once we were there it was exactly what we expected and more. Great place to recharge your batteries. Next to the splendid food, the vista, the great diving conditions, the accomodation, the personal we enjoyed very much hanging out in the Chill bar, looking into the sky from the over water deck and listening to the great DJ that plays very fine and suitable tunes every night. We will definitley come back!"
"If I could give half stars, I'd give it a 4.5, but since it was one of the better places I've ever stayed in my life, I was generous and rounded up. My husband and I spent 11 nights in the Maldives to celebrate our honeymoon, 6 nights at the Six Senses Laamu and 5 at the W Retreat & Spa. Coming all the way from NY, we really wanted to choose the right resort(s), and we absolutely did not go wrong with these two. When I did research for this trip, I hoped for more resort comparison, so I'll include some comparisons here. I also wrote a full review of the W. We were at the Six Senses the last week of February, the W the first week of March.   Overall: We preferred the resort layout of the Six Senses, it was more beautiful with much of the actual property being over water (though‚Ä¶"
"We had a very nice stay, but not quite a great one. First off, a quick tip: don't bother with half board. I don't think we saved any money doing it, and of course there is the loss of flexibility. Not all food was covered. Without it the food isn't cheap, but isn't overpriced ($100-150 pp) considering the quality of the dishes and the lengths needed to bring the ingredients in. So we very much enjoyed the food and the service. The whisky and wine lists were impressive given the location. The spa was one of the best we've visited. The over-water village feel of the common areas was interesting, and I am a fan of the rustic architecture. The fitness facilities and programmes might be the best I've ever seen at a resort. On the downside was the location. While it is nice to be so‚Ä¶"
"I do love the Maldives (although expect rain even in the dry season)! It‚Äôs the ultimate tropical paradise one dreams about when commuting to work in the dead of winter, and Six Senses does deliver this vacation dream in an attractive package: -	The island itself is very beautiful and quite big by Maldivian standards -	The villas (we stayed in a over water villa) is spacious and gorgeous on the inside and indulgently huge in terms of outside living space ‚Äì several sofas, hammock and sun beds ‚Äì WOW! -	The service is fantastic and attentive at every turn -	The food is really really good -	The water, even by Maldivian standards, is the most amazing shade of blue  A few aspects to be aware of, not as negatives, but in the category ‚Äúnot everyone‚Äôs cup of tea‚Äù: -	If you are located on‚Ä¶"
"This was our first vacation to the Maldives & was the 3rd stop of a 4 week holiday. Upon arrival into male, we were met by a Six Senses rep. Who assisted us with our luggage & took us to the domestic terminal to check-in for our flight to the resort. We had a 3-hour wait but we relaxed in the airport lounge. We knew we would have to wait prior to arrival, so this was expected.   As soon as we arrived at the resort, we were met by Jonathan (very friendly) & introduced to our GEM (guest experience maker) Abdullah. He showed us around the resort & took us to our over water villa. He was always available & checked on us daily, but was never intrusive. Which was fine with us, as we just wanted to relax & not have to be anywhere at a certain time.   As soon as we arrived, I took off‚Ä¶"
"I'll start the review by putting the title in perspective, my wife and I do a fairly significant number of trips each year and have stayed in some of the best hotels in the world. The six senses Laamu is by far and away the most incredible experience either of us has ever had the pleasure of being part of.  From the moment the GEM (guest experience makers) meet you at the airport to the time they drop you off, you literally have every need taken care of. We stayed for a week in a Ocean water villa (24).  Top 3 highlights of the trip: 1. The food - especially @ leaf, I'm pescatarian and was spoilt for choice 2. The villa - immaculate & extremely well designed 3. The staff - everyone you meet, from the gardener to general manager smiles & says hello every time they see you  I'm‚Ä¶"
"Our first stay here, so we couldn't help comparing it to another Maldives resort we visited twice before. Six Senses is casual, you walk around barefoot all the time, do not have to dress up for dinner - which I find really great. All the furniture etc. is from natural materials, which gives it an eco feeling. The Spa is excellent, the food is good (not great, but good), there are enough opportunities for the sporty guests. On the down side, the service is rather slow and it takes longer to reach the island than some other resorts."
"An absolutely wonderful holiday. We stayed 10 days in ocean beach villa no 88 and it was the perfect location. Completely private and our beach was just around a small point as seen from the public beach so completely secluded. Also we were at the leeward side of the island while the watervillas were at the windward. And the sunset from our beach was a must every evening. We were on half-board and had added the dine-around option. Do it! At only USD55 pp per day, you can dine in any restaurant ‚Äì and it includes in-villa a-la-carte breakfast and in-villa dining. That‚Äôs a treat. Being able to call at any time in the morning ordering exactly what you want ‚Äì and 40 minutes later it is laid for you where you prefer whether it‚Äôs at the treetop sundeck or in the shade in front of your‚Ä¶"
"Let me say from the start that this is a pretty wonderful place and a being there is a wonderful experience to have.  I have some negative things to say about it too, but as I do so towards the end of this long review, do not forget that I do think it is pretty amazing overall.  Or at least that there are some amazing things you can experience here like in very few other places on earth. There are places I prefer in the Maldives and I would not chose to go back here before going back to some other places and seeing some places I have not yet seen, but have had some of my favourite Maldivian moments here‚Ä¶ If you have never been to the Maldives you probably will be blown away but you will not experience a typical Maldivian holiday. If you have been elsewhere in the country, this‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses is an incredible experience! They ask you to remove your shoes as soon as you step into the speedboat that whisks you to the resort; instantly the mood is set for a leisurely, relaxing holiday. The concept of 'barefoot luxury' is executed meticulously throughout the resort, with aesthetics to match: in the bleached wood everywhere, in the open breezy villas, in the natural fresh food, but most of all in the colors! All the upholstery is in shades of cream, green and ...blue, blue and more blue! Blending perfectly with sea and the sky.  Everything was perfect. But, the standouts for us were a) the staff at the resort (Ali and his team!), the chefs (thanks for catering enthusiastically to my wife's vegetarian needs!), the dive center (Hiromi, we miss you!) b) The DJ‚Ä¶"
"We  just got back from a 10 day honeymoon at Six senses Laamu and what an experience! We organised the trip with Richard at Purely Maldives Ltd who we would recommend to anyone looking for an agency organised trip to these beautiful Islands. From touch down at Male airport every detail was ochestrated with great precision, an agent for Purely Maldives' sister company Hummingbird met us at arrivals and took us to the VIP waiting lounge whilst he made arrangements for our transfers to Laamu. The wait for the transfers was quick and we had access to refreshments, margazines, WiFi and air conditioning. After a short flight and speed boat ride we approached the Island after sunset which gave us the opportunity of seeing the resort in its lighted beauty.  Our GEM (Mashtouq) escorted‚Ä¶"
"I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a relaxing, yet fun vacation. Villas are large and beautifully decorated. I was especially impressed by the glass bathtub and the outdoor shower. They also provide privacy, which is not the case at all hotels in the Maldives. Although the hotel is not brand new, it is in top-condition. The island is large and full of natural vegetation. The food is absolutely incredible and all the staff is friendly and diligent. The hotel provides many opportunities, like fitness, yoga, snorkeling, dolphin excursions and so on.The atmosphere is perfected by the wonderful DJ at Chill Bar who plays very enjoyable tunes at night. I even asked him for a mix because I was so impressed by the music he was playing! A very relaxing,‚Ä¶"
"We went to Six Senses on a recommendation and weren't let down.  This place is truly special and the quality of the resort and its staff are exceptional.  We stayed in an overwater villa which I'm still lost for words at how truly luxurious and incredible the accommodation was.  With two shower heads for the outdoor shower, a see through bath and TV that could be watched in either the bath or bed, split level bed to outdoors, outdoor sunken table with see-through floor and many cute couches and nooks for snuggling and watching some of the most picturesque sunsets I've ever seen, this place is spectacular.  We had a beauitiful coral reef that we would dive from our villa and snorkel over to each morning.  The food (in partciular breakfast) was excellent with many options for‚Ä¶"
"There are many incredible properties in the Maldives. Six Senses Laamu (SSL) is no exception. It is about a 40 minute plane ride and a 25 minute boat ride from Male--understanding you may be waiting at the Male airport for your connection.  A representative from SSL met us to facilitate  the transfer. The style of resort is Eco luxury--lots of wood with soothing blues, greens and natural colors. There's an organic garden and desalination plant--they serve low or no carbon dinners, local seafood, re-use water bottles, etc.  Bare-feet are encouraged as are the use of your bikes The staff was terrific with personal attention led by an assigned ""Gem"" (guest entertainment manager?).

It is a long 48 hours of travel from the USA to get there but It was so worth it. Our entire experience was more than we had hoped for. The staff was friendly and so helpful. They knew you by name by the second day. Our water villa was spectactular. Everyday we would jump into the water to snorkle on a beautifully vibrant coral reef 100 ft away. The food was fresh and delicious.  A highlight was our 5 course wine dinner with a sommelier. My husband also enjoyed the scuba diving. We can't wait to go back and plan to stay longer than our 10 day trip.
Firstly this place is incredible i loved everything about the photos don't do it justice we spent 11 days in this fabulous for Our honeymoon we couldn't wait to see it and it took our breathe away the service is number one its more than any 5 star place I've certainly gone to and Deserves more we were in the lagoon water villa n.3 it was close to everything which i loved the restaurants beach and spa/gym .Our GEM was name arif he was so nice he showed us around and also everyday told us new activities that were on on and on the last night he did a special surprise for us with a honeymoon cake on his owner which was so nice and our second night we went to seafood barbeque on leaf beach and set up nice the food was incredible .The Staff were over the top kind I cant thank them‚Ä¶
"It took us a couple days to take in the sheer beauty of the place which is paired with impecable service that makes you feel welcome at any time. Food is great albeit the wines are a little bit on the expensive side (high import tax). We strongly recommend the Chill Bar for relaxed food, amazing sunsets, shishas, great bar food and the best chill out / lounge music we have ever come across. The resident DJ is excellent! Cheers, m"
"Excuse the cliche but it's hard to find another way to describe this place other than paradise. Every detail you caan imagine and even the ones you can't are attended to. The only thing that surpasses the jaw droppping beauty of Olhuveli island is the service and facilities provided by the six senses staff.  A special mention must be made for the dive team who are extremely professional, friendly and knowledgable. Also our GEM Natsumi who worked tirelessly to ensure our stay was everything we were hoping it would be and more.  The food and drink is exceptional with so much varietly for a relatively small resort.  The house reef is bursting with exotic marine life and coral making for breathtaking snorkelling all around the island. The water villa was stunning and beautifully‚Ä¶"

"Came back couple of weeks ago from a 7 nights stay in the Six Senses Laamu with my Husband, in summary Fantastic Retreat. Selected this hotel based on our excellent experience with the Sex Senses Zighy Bay and the SS Laamu was at par in terms of the total experience.  A Luxurious Eco-Friendly Hotel with great respect to the environment around it while maintaining the level of service you expect from a luxury chain.   Obviously there is no hotel in the world with no shortfalls thus here are the Pros and Cons in my opinion:  Pros:  - Lovely Villas, we tried The Ocean Water Villa both in Pier A and B for 4 nights and The Ocean Beach Villa for 3 nights. Read the specs on their website and see photos, what you see is what you will get for real in terms of the Villa‚Äôs Interior.  -‚Ä¶"
"We have been at Six Senses Laamu for our honeymoon (7 nights) and honestly it is hard to find, and even think, of something much better than this island. It is my third time at Maldives and Six Senses has been the best place with no doubts.  We landed in Male and Six Senses personnel escorted us to a Lounge while waiting for the next local flight to bring us down to the Laamu Atoll, one of the most unspoiled in the country. After a 50 minutes flight, we landed in Kadhoo and a speed boat brought us to the island.   The island is incredibly private and well mixed with nature. There are three ""jettys"" with Water Villas and several beach rooms around the island. We stayed in a water villa and had an amazing time. The view of the laguna is incredible, never seen colours like the ones‚Ä¶"
"A long way to travel from Australia but absolutely worth the effort. From the moment we touched down in Male every little detail was taken care of to ensure ease of transfer to the island. Once there we were greeted by a number of senior staff members who maintained a strong presence throughout the stay ensuring that everything was just right. We were introduced the our personal GEM - guest entertainment manager who helped plan our itinerary of activities with us. This meant at no point did we feel rushed to do things or that we were missing out on anything and were just able to kick back and enjoy our honeymoon. I don't think anything we had read or seen on the Internet could have truly prepared us for the amazing experience. Without going into too much detail, if you are‚Ä¶"
"Like the reviewer below me, I can't believe people found anything to complain about at Six Senses.  Unless you expect to have your own personal army of people looking after you 24/7, and picking up all your rubbish, I really don't understand the problem!  The island was beautiful - and as natural as it could possibly be given it's a resort.  'No shoes' policy and no dressing for dinner was a lovely change - evenings spent in the rustic Chill bar on comfortable sofas, overlooking the sea and listening to some perfectly themed 'chill' music, was a great way to spend an evening.  We actually didn't partake of any activity on the island (we didn't want to or were pushed to), apart from the Tuesday night party on the beach - cocktails, wine, beer, traditional music and dancing and a‚Ä¶"
"We stayed 7 nights in December 2012 in a Ocean Water Villa. Our flight arrived in Male around 8:30 AM. Shortly after, we were taken care of by a rep who helped us check-in the domestic flight. We stayed in the lounge where they provided breakfast. Wi-fi is available which is nice. Our domestic flight was around 10 AM and took less than 1 hour. A quick boat ride took us to the island, dolphins welcoming us halfway throught the trip. Very smooth and quick transfers overall.  Our check-in was quick and easy, our GEM took us to our room and explained a few things about the resort. Luggage came in shortly after. We booked an Ocean Villa and were assigned #9, halfway through the jetty. The villa is amazing. Quite big with a nice outside shower, see-through bathtub, small balcony‚Ä¶"
"We have just returned from Six Senses Laamu and can't believe that anyone could complain. It is an absolutely beautiful resort. We stayed in a lagoon villa which was great, always cleaned and tidied perfectly. The food was great albeit expensive but no more than other five star island resorts. The staff in the restaurants were great and most spoke fairly good english as well as other languages, Niyaz in Longitude was outstanding  and remembered what we drank and how we liked our eggs each morning. Abidha, the lady who works in the icecream shop was most helpful and you could tell she loved her job.

"what can I say expect it was amazing. From the moment we arrived in Male we were greeted by the Six Senses Staff at the airport and from there it just got better. We stayed in an overwater villa which was amazing!!!!   Cooking class was great and even though we didn't see many dolphins on the dolphin cruise the experience is one I will never forget. We also had a private dinner on the beach which is something I highly recommend doing, the food was great and the service was amazing. Breathtaking views of the sunset while having dinner and sipping a class of wine with nobody else around was definitely worth the extra money.   We just LOVED IT!!!! will definitely be going back."
"The island, the villa and the reef all met our expectations. The beach is beautiful, the beach villa has enough privacy and enough space. The sea and the reef are both so beautiful so there is no need for pool. Snorkeling is amazing, although it is quite a swim to get to the sand bank along the reef. All the reviews mostly describe well the atmosphere and the beauties of the resort.  I suggest beach villas 93-89. They are at the best part of the beach, with most privacy. Water villas are very close to each other, and as they have no yard, they are quite smaller in your area than the beach villas. The only difference is in beach villa you have mosquitos, in water villa you don't.  I have several remarks: - Service:  - our housekeeper leaves the lights on and the windows and doors‚Ä¶"

Jungle cinema is a great concept and very enjoyable, though the popcorn was poor and champagne never materialized.  Enjoyed the GM cocktail party with local dancing  & drumming.   Water villas are amazing, however be sure you get the room you booked - they tried to put us in a less room, and we had to fight to be moved to what we'd booked - only on the second day.

Fly in the ointment was getting away as there was a problem at the airport, and once Six Senses has sent you off - you're‚Ä¶"
"We spent a few nights at Laamu in December after having the best honeymoon in Maldives a few years ago. We chose this resort because we wanted to experience something different from ultra-modern luxury and liked the 'natural' feel of Six Senses. While we had a great time, there seem to be a few quirks that the resort still has...  - Food:  Healthy options, great ice cream selections, fresh juice options, and cocktails, attention to detail, breakfasts, etc. However overall taste was just so so...Also, if you want to have in-villa dining, they charge $10 per tray! This is really not understandable given the prices are already higher than the same exact dish in the restaurants. After the extra 16% tax, you were starting to pay a fortune for just a burger or pizza. This made us lug‚Ä¶"
"It was totally worthful after 8+ hours flight when I saw the excellent island. I would not talk more about the excellent serice or food there while you can see on the other feedback. Just a tip for those non-speaking travellers, there is only one GEM there who can speak Chinese but she is a little bit busy. You can not find her 24-hours standby. But some waiter could speak simple Chinese and they are so friendly to talk with you in funny Chinese :) Actually I was delay because of problem with flight system but hotel re-arrange schedule pretty well including hotel & food free while stay in island and re-schedule flight back home. Hoping I could visit laamu. Ooh, BTW, highly recommed take outside island picnic, wonderful day there!"
"Apart from the length of time to reach the resort, everything else was close to perfection. The property design is just amazing and so are the villas. The ones furthest away on the 3 jetties are the most private. We stayed at the end of jetty C and were absolutely impressed with just about everything in the villas. The only thing missing was a personal infinity pool, but quite frankly they are not needed. The jetties/villas can be quite a long bike ride, so this resort might not be best suitable for the elderly or small children. The resort however seems to cater to all types of travellers, from honeymooners to families with young children with their grandparents. Maybe Six Senses is trying to hard to be all things to all people.  The food is great, maybe the croissants and the‚Ä¶"
Our experience at Six Senses was everything we hoped for. The staff was wonderful up until we tried to actually leave :-). Do plan for and expect some possible challenges getting to and from the resort. While the Six Senses staff are great the local transportation is outside of their control and is unfortunately not that reliable based on our experience.  The house reef is great and the water sports center is excellent with lots of options for great ways to enjoy the island waters.
"Despite the length of time it took to get to the property, it was well worth it. This place is the stuff honeymoon dreams are made of. It is expensive, but for a once in a lifetime trip for us - it was worth every cent. Staff were fantastic, facilities amazing, food incredible. Leaf restaurant was on par with any top restaurant I have eaten at. One of our highlights was the Maldivian cooking class we did with one of the chefs at Leaf - hands on, just the two of us in the class and we got to eat all our food at the end of it! Bravo Six Senses!"
"I have spent there a week in September. The hotel is very well design and has absolutely all facilities needed in the island. Very well combined, bit of luxury and ecological staff. Amazing views, water flow, landscapes, a lots of facilities in la villa to really enjoy and indulge yourself! Food is amazing and the attention from F&B excellent. Big Thank you goes to Jordi, excellent choice of cheeses, olive oils, wines and all food in general, Amazing healthy and very variable breakfast. Ice cream store - first in class, about 40 different flavors, all homemade and very originally mixed- never taste anything better in life entire. The rest of the services should be better and faster.

"We recently spent 6 nights at the Six Senses Laamu, staying in one of the water villas. It was a great experience overall, with only a couple of minor negatives.  To start with the positives, the island itself is lovely and the design well thought through. There are three jetties of water villas, with beach villas dotted around the sides of the island. We were on jetty C, which was the furthest from the main dining/reception complex and so the most private. We had requested this in advance and it was great that they met this request. It was around 5 minutes' cycle (bikes provided free) to the main complex from our villa, which was fine for us, but might be a bit more of an issue for those with a young family or who are mobility impaired.  The villa itself was lovely - very‚Ä¶"
Been there for 8 days early December 2012. The staff is extreemely nice and friendly and everybody has a smile whenever you are being approached. Being accustomed to average European service it was a fresh wake-up call that there are still regions (Asia and others) where people know what service means and not being treated like someone who disturbs the staff by doing nothing. Food was great and wine list for the exotic location respectable. Being a vivid double espresso drinker I had to raise my eyebrows though to see that they charge 2x $8 for that drink. It would deserve a price adjustment to be frank! Staying at a beach villa we had also to insist to move to another villa as the number 96 is way too near to the power generator. To sum up I can recommend to go there!
"We stayed at this resort for 7 nights for our honeymoon. We spent five nights in overwater villa and two nights in beach villa. Both gave us different but memorable experience to remember for a long time if not a life time.   Our experience started as soon as we landed in Male. We were taken care of by one of their representatives at the airport. He did all the paperwork for domestic transfers and took us to the transfer lounge where we could rest up and had some buffet lunch. Nothing fancy here but they had free Wi fi to kill some times. After few hours of waiting, 35mins of domestic flight and 15mins speed boat ride, we reached the resort. (try to book early flight to Male from wherever you are, to land around 10-11am as it does take some times to get to the resort with the‚Ä¶"
"We spent two weeks at this resort for our honeymoon and it was the best holiday either of us have ever been on.  We stayed in a water villa (#13) on Jetty A and it was stunning.  We had read previous reviews saying that Jetty A was the best one for water villa accommodation and so we requested this Jetty when our travel agent made the booking. If you love to snorkel its the best Jetty to stay on as you can just swim straight out to the amazing reef from there.  All of the staff were lovely and I cant thank our GEM Inthi enough for arranging much needed replacement medication for me that I had stupidly left behind in Singapore.  Without this our honeymoon would have been a disaster!  The food was amazing, the service outstanding and most of all the welcoming smiles from all the‚Ä¶"
"Beatufully setup resort with a very friendly staff. We will keep our memories fresh for a long time by looking at the pictures we took and listen to Bar'el's music selection at the Chill Bar he kindly shread with us.  The jetty villa was excellent and you can spend a lot of time there. The food was very good aynwhere you eat. Even a simple pizza was very tasty. But for buffet nights, some of the selections disappear very quickly. Seafood buffet was not impressive though. Quite good and wide spectrum of wine. We felt sorry that we tasted the ice cream on the last day, very creative varierty.  Whom watched Seinfend ""Soup Nazi"" episode, you might associate this with dive instructor Dagmar."
"The water villa and its surrounding was beautiful. The view and cleanliness of the villa was perfect. The hotel by itself was perfect.   Only problem we encountered was....the resort ran out of snorkelling gears for 3 days. Resort was in full capacity so we were on the waiting list for the gears and did not receive the snorkelling gears till an hour before our check out. That did ruin our pleasant stay in the hotel. What's the point of being in Maldives but one didn't get to snorkle?! 4 days of our stay and we had an hour to snorkle. Not happy!  Also, I found that the staff were overselling just about everything?!   Our GEM told us about this amazing experience where you get to spend nearly a whole day at an island (plus a picnic) by yourselves while we were checking in. I rang‚Ä¶"
"this place is amazing from the minute they pick you up from the airport!!!! what can i say, you are allocated a GEM (guest experience maker) and they are truly a gem...they attend to your every request and ensure your trip runs as best as possible. the waters are so clean...the rooms are AMAZING. we stayed a night on the beach villa and then 6 nights in a water villa. we still cant choose which we preferred. if we HAD to choose id say the beach villa would be preferred if you had kids but if you are after that amazing free feeling to jump in the ocean id go for the ocean villa! also, if you are after privacy then definently make sure you ask for a ocean water villa in either B or C arms.  also you get allocated a bicycle to get around the island but its easy for you to walk it! ‚Ä¶"
"We are just marriage couple,  and staying there for 5 night. We prepare for this trip for so long,  and it won't disappointed us. Except the beginning,  our GEM Inthi told us our luggage would be delayed for few hours due to arrangement problem.  My wife just feel sad,  I can understand as girl like keep clean. by the way,  the place is really beautiful and wonderful.  We stayed in a water villa in jelly A, in front of us is a edgeless ocean with crystal water.  All guests and staff are happy to see you,  just feel free to said hi and talk with them.  Food in there are delicious, especially chinese food,  as we come from HK, we try trendous types of chinese food before,  we also tast it as local yummy,  thank you the chef who come from Malay. The breakfast buffit is also good, ‚Ä¶"
"This was our second trip to Laamu, the first in April this year was cut short by illness.  The resort was magnificent the first time and has got even better.  The property epitomises ""barefoot luxury"" - no shoes were worn or needed from arrival to departure.   ACCOMMODATION  The accommodation, in Six Senses fashion was both quirky and of the highest quality. Rooms, mainly over-water bungalows are spacious and apart from the first 4 or 5 on jetty number one ( which I would avoid) have a high degree of privacy. The in room equipment is as one would expect from a resort of this quality, with high quality  soundless air conditioning  i  pod docks and a flat screen tv though quite why one would come to the Maldives to watch TV is questionable. The bungalow was spotless and this was‚Ä¶"
"We stayed here in July 2012, such a disappointment after our other Maldive trips. First of all I will say the local resort staff were lovely as always. Shelomi runs the kids club, and this I cannot fault, Shelomi was fun, safe, inspiring and so much fun with the kids. Inti our room guy was again lovely with excellent service. Sadly the resort is let down by the watersports centre. My husband goes to surf and sadly this was so overpriced, charging $160 for a short trip in a dinghy each time to get to a break that sadly was not so good, the watersports centre did not check the surf each day or recommend best time to go out often the surf was not suitable but still charged us thousands of dollars, in fact the watersports manager was overheard saying that our bill for watersports‚Ä¶"
"We stayed for 10 nights at the most gorgeous six senses. After our tour through India. It was so nice to come to the Maldives for its beauty and peacefulnes. We stayed in a beach villa or small house. It was so spacious so many areas to be upstairs, outside, inside on the beach you choose. I loved how we where given bikes as form of transport to get around the island which takes a round 10 mins to do one lap if you are keen. Our Gem he was so lovely any tiny request he would help you out so sweet. Breakfast in the morning was an adventure every day, the choice was amazing considering everything has to be bought in beautifully fresh. We met the head chief one night early in to our stay and mentioned to him I was vegetarian, well that a lucky encounter as from that moment on a got‚Ä¶"
"Six senses Laamu was our second experience in Maldives, after  Baros. We stayed for 6 unforgettable nights in an outstanding Beach villa ocean view. It had a private beach and the whole villa lay out was just amazing. Every single corner is made to feel comfortable for enjoying the wonderful views of the turquoise sea. The concept of the resort it is ""green"" and ""sustainable"" without forgetting total confort and luxury. The food is very good, especially in the Vietnamese restaurant. I really recommend the romantic beach lobster barbacue. Breakfast was rich in choices. And the buffet at lunch time at the Cooking hut is also remarkable, with maldivan currys. The trip to our private island for a day was fun but I expected a cleaner island plus be advised about the hundred mosquitos‚Ä¶"
"We have recently honeymooned in Laamu and stayed in one of their luxurious and spacious water bungalows. It is one of the nicest resorts we have stayed at. Our GEM, Auzam was very pleasant and helpful as were all the staff. The food, chefs and catering staff were all exceptional. The produce was extremely fresh and tasty. Breakfast Buffet awesome. We did the beach BBQ on Sunday night and had the most wonderful lobster and seafood dinner, right on the beach. Prices for the wine, were to be honest, high, but one must understand everything needs to be shipped in. Wine selection was tremendous.  There was a small coral reef right outside our water bungalow which was teeming with several varieties of fish. The outdoor seating area and outdoor shower are unique. Glass panels in the‚Ä¶"
"Spent here six nights as an end to our journey that had started in India. This was my third trip to the Maldives, a place that I truly love. We've booked an overwater villa, lovely indeed, on the lagoon side. The sea here is just an immense pool, so very turqouise and clear. Villa has simple furnishings, eco- friendly style, the shower area is big and I also loved the glassbottomed tub, you could see the sea underneath. I loved the fact that you're given bicycles to explore the island, also an expression of their eco-friendliness. Our GEM's(Guest Experience Maker) name was Inthi. He was a really nice, helpful guy, but as far as I could see, all Gems were the same, as was the entire staff, including the managers. In terms of diving my husband said here were the best sites in the‚Ä¶"
"We have recently holidayed in Laamu and stayed in one of their luxurious and spacious water bungalows. It is one of the nicest resorts we have stayed at. We have just read a review on TA criticizing the food, but this was not our experience. We found the food, chefs, catering staff all to be exceptional. The produce was extremely fresh and tasty. Our GEM, Auzam was very pleasant and helpful as were all the staff. The Den (Kids Club) staff, particularly, Shelomi & Numa were great with our daughter.  There was a small coral reef right outside our water bungalow which was teeming with several varieties of fish. The outdoor seating area and outdoor shower are unique. Glass panels in the toilet floor and glass bath with turquoise sea beneath is surreal. Don't let the longish flight‚Ä¶"
"From the moment we arrived we felt like we were being spoilt by the staff at Laamu. They were friendly, personal and professional and made nothing seem like too much effort.  The food was amazing, the scenery was breathtaking. It was nice to see the restaurant staff so keen to play with the small children. The layout of the place was interesting in a very good way.  Bar'el, the DJ, played fantastic music at night and shared some inspiring thoughts. It was a pleasure to meet him and have a drink in the bar Chill because of this.  All up a very pleasant stay in an amazing place. Thank you!"
"As most of the places in the Maldives, the resort was very very beautiful. Crystal clear water, blue sky, occasional dolphins pass by, awesomeness. The resort is Six Senses standard so you can't really go wrong with it. Very nice rooms, great bed, great service - special thanks to our GEM (Guest Experience Maker) ""Auzam"" who made our trip so great. We missed the water villas because it was overbooked, so we stayed in the beach villa where we had our very own private beach instead. Shower was great, again, Six Senses standard - coolest shower ever. Breakfast was perfect but I'd say the one in Six Senses Koh Kood is actually better. Kudos to the ice cream and chocolate bar.   The only thing that was exceptionally bad was the food (excluding breakfast of course). We'd recommend you‚Ä¶"
"Fantastic place! Clean ocean with a super house reef. Friendly staff. Comfortable conditions for a great holiday life - modern beach villa, various restaurants. One night I met an ovipositing  turtle !!!! We found an idea to offer complimentary bikes for each villa inspiring and amazing, riding it recalled our fun youth feelings. Our family was really happy there and we had everything for that: professional service, positive atmosphere and stunning nature."
"It was our first time at a Sixth Senses resort after having stayed at both Four Seasons and Banyan Tree in Maldives. My husband and I really wanted to like this place (especially since it's our 2nd wedding anniversary but we left feeling letdown by the service we heard so much abt on tripadvisor. Our GEM, Hassan, is great, so was the incredibly patient Steve at the watersports centre (who btw is a great surfing teacher!) but there were a couple of unpleasant experiences that we didn't expect and were somewhat surprised that other guests have not written or encountered it. Maybe it's just our luck but I don't think we were being anal abt our stay experience.  The first unpleasant experience came from their diving centre. I think it is an outsourced outfit which prob partially‚Ä¶"
"We've just returned from our honeymoon at Six Senses Laamu. I have never written a review here, but this place deserves one. 'Paradise on earth' is a cliche, but it's an accurate one.  Resort  The island itself is pristine, not over-developed, with stunning views, colours and surroundings. You really do feel like you're on a jungle tropical island, without any of the discomforts (we went during the Wet Monsoon but it only rained once in 11 days, at night). This is not an opulent, over-the-top mega-resort. Rather, it is a wellness resort dedicated to living well, and the look and feel of the place are natural, understated, super-comfortable and absolutely gorgeous. They've done a great job of immersing guests in the 'Slow Life' experience. The Spa is beautiful and the treatments‚Ä¶"
"An amazing place, the best equipped water villas I've ever seen. Great bathroom facilities with 2 showers, a glass bottom bath and all overlooking the amazing ying yang surf break, not overlooked at all. The sound system in the villa was easily integrated to and the Bose sound system was fantastic quality and well set-up for the environment. I completed several dives with all university educated dive masters who new safety and detail of sites impeccably. Mantas, Sharks, Neudis and Leaf fish were all seen. My wife was pregnant and the staff were good to accommodate food wise, and the spa had a pregnancy massage  too. The bar has an amazing selection of liqueurs and cocktails and they have a full time DJ and percussionist there as well who also sorts out the music for the venues‚Ä¶"
"My wife & I stayed here in September 2012 for 15 glorious nights. The reefs and the marine life were the best! Snorkeling with turtles and stingrays over a beautiful reef - cool! The quality of our over-water ocean villa, the resort facilities are absolutely first class. The food is so fresh and the chefs so talented. As we know it's the people that make a pace and the people here could not be friendlier or more helpful. All of this in a resort that lives up to Six Senses renowned sustainability credentials.  An extra special feature of our time in Laamu was having well known DJ Bar'el Wachtel entertaining everyone each evening for sunset cocktails in the over-water Chill bar and hearing his music while we enjoyed dinner in Longitude, and for after dinner drinks. One suggestion‚Ä¶"
"My husband and I stayed here in March of 2012.  Overall, we loved the place and hope to go back again.  The vibe is very organic, beachy, relaxed - no shoes required anywhere at the resort (makes packing much easier!).  We saw mostly couples, small groups of young adults, and families with young children.  Very internationally diverse clientele.  This is a great resort if you just want to chill out outdoors in a very natural, quiet, and eco-friendly environment.  Not the place to go to if you want a pool or beach social ""scene"".  Here's a list or pros and cons that I thought of after the trip.  Pros: *Absolutely gorgeous location - tons of fish and rays to look at right next to our villa *Despite flying on two planes and taking a boat to get to the island, everything went very‚Ä¶"
"This is my 5th visit to Maldives. this resort is far from Male, once you arrive , you need to board another local plane(jet) not the normal sea-planes as for most resort and take a 50 min flight to Kadadu Island, then 15- min boat ride to the resort. Jonthan the Manger is a real asset for this resort, he is there to greet the guests as they arrive, introduce them to their (GEM) , and keep taking care of every need the guests might need during their stay. the Guests are provided with bicycles or tricycles to go around the Island. we were a family of 5 in two villas an ocean-water villa facing by door another Lagoon-water villa, both locations were good. once the storm came and it did on two days when we were there we still managed to stay in the terrace of the Lagoon villa, while‚Ä¶"
"Staying here isn't cheap but it is worth every penny. If you are looking for a paradise island this is for you. The hotel is beautifully designed, lots of wood that fits into the landscape. The water villas are stunning and spacious with various seating areas. The staff are amazing and nothing is too much for them. The perfect romantic destination (there is a kids club)"
"On arrival at Male airport you do not expect the service to extend that far away from the beautiful resort.  The surprise is; it starts as soon as you come off the plane.  The friendly face of the Six Senses resort will sort any problem you are faced with immediately (lost luggage) and take you down the journey of relaxation.  Once you reach the resort time seems to stand still!  The staff are always accommodating and everyone including the guests have a smile on their face.  You feel like you are the only guests on the island until you want to engage with others.  Our experience will be one to remember for a long time to come, and we hope to experience again in the near future.  Thank you to all for a truly memorable experience, for those we met we hope to be in touch again‚Ä¶"
"9 nights were not enough.... Laamu was simply amazing.  Everything was perfect.   Snorkeled off the villa daily w variety of fish puffer triggers lion and the standard cast of tropical fish.  Food great, esp the Buffett nights.  Staff friendly and always available   Diving was good too. Petra is awesome.    Rarely saw other guests outside of meals."
"The hotel is visually stunning and very well maintained. The staff are well trained and provide an excellent level of service. We arrived at the local airport at dusk in challenging weather/sea conditions and the boat transfer to the island took 60 minutes rather than the usual 15/20 minutes. The boat was in good mechanical condition and the boatman and his crew were excellent and highly competent and at no time did we feel at risk during a lengthy boat ride, in stormy conditions in the dark. They should be congratulated.  The shoreline villas and water villas all involve at least a five minute ride, (longer if you decide to walk) either by golf cart (only 2 available) or by bicycle, from the main hotel public areas. Our arrival in high winds and heavy rain did not make it easy‚Ä¶"
"We just returned from 10 days in paradise.  This is, hands-down, one of the most beautiful and relaxing places we have ever been.  Pictures cannot do it justice. The service was impeccable, the villa was lovely and the food was great.  The only thing (after 10 days) that got a bit old was the breakfast buffet.  There were many options, but we were ready for something different.  And be aware that cocktails are at a premium - $16-$22 each...with no other option."
"This is most likely the best place I have ever been to. Even though transport here is a bit complicated (but well organized) it is completely worth it. Six Senses with its award-winning (and deserved) architecture is being quoted all over the internet, especially pictures from this hotel. It is as perfect as it looks. Many people said they get bored in Maldives but not in Six Senses! You can do lots of activities here when you want to but on the other hand you can enjoy as much privacy as you need. Delicious cuisine, outstanding service, astonishing contact with nature (they go all green) makes stay here really unforgettable experience. I could not find a single negative thing what to say since everything went really great. Not to mention spa here, all the procedures were in‚Ä¶"
"My new wife and I enjoyed a fantastic 12 night honeymoon at Six Senses Laamu and I felt compelled to write my first ever tripadvisor review.  From the moment we were met at by a Six Senses rep at Male airport our dream honeymoon began.  We stayed in a Lagoon water villa that presented the ultimate in luxury accommodation including an outdoor shower area (supported by a top of the range Bose sound system), a double sun lounger, fridge and amazing 5* details at every opportunity.   A special mention goes to:  Saddam, our GEM, who was incredibly helpful when we needed anything and, equally as important, also left us in peace when we didn‚Äôt.

"First expression was shocking! Such a beautiful resort mainly built above the water, the ""Gem"" service which makes you feel like at home, and the room attendance refresh the room and refill the drinking water twice a day, this is more than what you expected, it is worth to stay as long as you like!"
"The Six Senses staff especially Marteyne the GM and Hannah our GEM are wonderful, truly professional and down to earth people. They will make your stay special for sure! The great experience starts with riding a bicycle throughout the sandy paths of this beautiful island barefoot of course because you don't need your shoes for the rest of your stay. Organic gardens,wonderful restaurants and bars, healthy juices, great snorkeling and most importantly: peace.... breathtaking SPA with such peaceful natural concept you have never seen before, just try a massage in a bird`s nest treatment room facing the ocean and see the difference from your previous spa visits! We stayed in a very stylish beach villa. Great design and privacy. This hotel is all about the natural yet luxurious‚Ä¶"
"Unspeakable joy, the journey to knew six senses laamu interesting friends, including the staff, management, and disc jockey talkative and full of summer, there are many, many ... if stay a month there would be great ......."
"This is a special place to really relax in and enjoy. We especially enjoyed the uncrowded surfing at the aptly named Yin Yangs break. The kids club was one of the few where the kids actually wanted to go. The food and drink are exceptional. The staff are friendly, helpful and approachable.  Have to say that sitting at sunset in the chill bar listening to the excellent mixes from Bar'el, the super chilled resident DJ, reflecting on another day of surfing and surrounded by friends and family is a memory that will stay for a long time. Gotta get back there soon."
"There is not a bad word that can be said about this place!  Nature speaks for itself in the way of beautiful beaches, gorgeous dive spots and fab weather! We did travel during Monsoon season and it was perfect weather all day every day!!  The staff, the food and the entire experience is one that my husband and I will never forget!  A wonderful experience that I cannot recommend enough!!!"
"We decided to come to Six Senses Laamu for our Honeymoon. First credits go to Kuoni for having it all organised to the detail! In Male we were welcomed by 2 reps (Kuoni and Six Senses) to escort us to our connecting flight and in Kadhdhoo Airport we met our Six Senses GEM (Guest Experience Maker), Hasan, who from there on made sure our Honeymoon was an unforgettable one! The service at Six Senses Laamu is one of the best I've experienced. Everything is possible and no is not an answer.   About the Resort:  We stayed in an Ocean View water villa on jetty A (#19) which had a beautiful sunrise view and unrestricted views to the horizon. Inside the villa it's all about relaxing, luxury and Eco friendliness. Every day you are provided with fresh fruit and all sorts of lotions to make‚Ä¶"
"We were at 6 Senses Laamu Atoll in June and had a fantastic time.  It's definitely the place to rest, relax and indulge.  The atmosphere is very chilled and above all the resort is charming and beautiful.  A live DJ (Mobius), on his set of tam-tams was there every afternoon to set a chillout ambiance whilst we relaxed at the seafront sunset terrace sipping our favorite cocktails and being stunned by the sight of dolphins jumping out the water right there in front of us!  The food is excellent and the chocolate room next to the home made ice cream parlour is quite a treat.  The blue turquoise lagoon is quite remarkable and directly accessible for a snorkelling session from the outside deck.  The water villa rooms are very spacious and extremely confortable for a fantastic night‚Ä¶"
"We thought we've seen it all at SS, but Laamu takes it to a whole new level.  Upon our arrival, and after greetings from the GM and the team we were introduced to a dedicated GEM (equivalent to the buttler concept at other SS resorts and were anticipating to experience it). To our pleasant surprise we discovered an intricate and discreet network of hosts that works around the clock to make sure our stay was an exceptional one.  Let's start from the amazing resort design, raw island ""jungle"" sceneries, breath taking views, solid and sustainable concepts as well as live chill out music DJ Bar'el who made sure that we were greeted with our favorite tunes every time we walked into the bar area.  Our ocean water villa offered extreme privacy with uninterrupted views to the splendor‚Ä¶"
"We just came back from our best holidays we ever had. I travel a lot and always stay in five star hotels or more. But what we experienced the last two weeks was amazing. We are still dreaming of this beautiful resort.  It is a barefoot Island where you don‚Äôt have to dress up for dinner, thank goodness! It is an easy going Island. It starts with the arrival in Mal√®, where an employee from the Six Senses Group picks you up at the airport, you will be accompanied to the national depature area, where you can wait at a lounge (with free offered breakfast, lunch, dinner and different drinks) for your next 35 minutes national flight to the neighbor Island of Laamu. There are 4 flights a day, so maybe you have to wait 2 to 3 hours for your connection flight, maybe just 30 minutes, it‚Ä¶"
"Wow!! Wooooowww! Wwwoooowwww!! That's the best description of Maldives and Six Senses!?, what an amazing experience... :))) i went with a friend back on Aug for 4 days!! It was awesome, the staff is super friendly and helpful, they will remember your name all your stay!!, the activities are diverse,you have many options, snorkeling, dive... The spa is great! I love that iced lemon tea!! Food is good, straight good.. The villas are spacious and comfy, the bare foot policy is fun until you find yourself walking at noon in the superhot wood floor!! I loved riding the bike!! I strongly recommend you visit this resort!!"
"We just came back from our honeymoon there and we wish we could go back already! It is the most beautiful place and the Six Senses Laamu allows you to enjoy it making you feel as part of the natural environment. It has been a great experience. We have been in a water villa, lagoon view in Jetty B and we have liked it a lot. The food is totally delicious and the staff is really nice and friendly. We had half board and it was enough for us as the breakfast buffet is amazing and for dinner you can choose different very nice menus that won't let you hungry. Also the tematic buffets have been delicious! During the day we could enjoy the amazing snorkelling right in front of the place or a bit further to the sand bank, and at night DJ Bar'el and the nice cocktails made the evening‚Ä¶"
"I Recently  returned from 9 nights at Laamu and now it seems like a dream. Its an amazing place to unwind and do very little in very private villas, or entertain yourself with many activities on offer daily. The staff here cruise around bare feet and their uniforms blend in with the atmosphere. The aesthetics of the entire resort puts you in holiday mode the moment you step off the boat. I personally have never had such consistent high quality food, with so much variety on offer. The afternoon/night cocktails sessions were a daily must. Their was an Australian DJ named Bar'el who played some fantastic lounge music. Great to kick back, watching the sunset with killer tunes. Bar'el was super friendly, very approachable and made an effort to make the people he was entertaining‚Ä¶"
"We had 9nts at Laamu for our honeymoon and there was not a single thing we could fault! We stayed in a Water Villa and it was amazing! The whole resort had a very relaxed rustic feel to it, however the service and attention to details were 110%. The food was spectacular and the servings quite large - definately value for money! Their cocktail & wine lists was massive & the cocktails were made WELL!! The staff was happy to be there and happy to chat with you - it was obvious that the resort valued their staff, as they all seemed very happy to be working there! Our expectations before we arrived at Laamu, were pretty high - we knew it was going to be awesome. However from the moment we arrived, our expectations were well and truely surpassed. Not a bad thing we could say about the‚Ä¶"
"My husband & I travelled to Six Senses Laamu in early June.  It was our first trip to the Maldives but certainly won't be the last.  It truly is a dream luxury paradise.  The quality of the resort itself is outstanding & the food is excellent.  The service & staff are extremely good & I would like to extend a thank you to our GEM Inaz who catered for all our requests. The highlights of this resort is firstly it's location - a surf break which was very popular with my husband is only a ten minute boat ride & the snorkelling was very good - beautiful corals, tropical fish & turtles are all close by.  The sunsets were gorgeous each evening but I must say the most beautiful experience was the private BBQ on the sandbank.  I highly recommend anyone going to this resort to book this -‚Ä¶"
"My wife and I travelled to Laamu in early June and were lucky with the weather which was great apart from a couple of windy days. This is our first (but hopefully not our last) trip to the Maldives.  Getting There  We travelled from the UK so the overall journey time is pretty long given that once you land in Male you need to catch a connecting flight to Khadhoo which takes around 40 mins or so.  We had around two hours between landing and catching this flight but it didn't feel too draining as the Six Senses staff take all your luggage, check you in and then lead you to a decent lounge where you can refresh yourself.  Once in Khadhoo you take a short speedboat ride (15-20mins) to Laamu. We were lucky enough to encounter some dolphins on our transfer so we stopped for a while‚Ä¶"
I am on my last day here in a water villa on jetty A. The place is beautifully situated - a long journey from the UK but so worthwhile. Watching dolphins jump out of the water from the seclusion of well thought out villa is priceless.  Rooms - I am very fussy about cleanliness & room layout. Six senses have thought out the accommodation both in the villa & on the decking very well. So many specs to lounge about & sunbathe & the reef literally at your feet! Only comment I have is the outside bath wasn't as successful. I tried to fill it up one evening & lost enthusiasm when I realised how long it old take to fill. I think it would have worked well incorporated into the inside of the villa & perhaps the glass is more style over function! But this is minor when they have got‚Ä¶
"Better to late then never! We had never been to the Six Senses before but if we get the opportunity, we would definitely go again! What a place! Absolutely stunning, everything is just close to perfection! We arrived with our 2 children (4 & 2) after a long international flight in Mal√© where we were welcomed at the Six Senses lounge where we got drinks and club sandwiches. The heat and food was welcomed by all of us and we were very fast in a ""vacation mood"". Even though we had to take another internal flight and a short boat trip we arrived at a reasonable time in Laamu in order to enjoy an afternoon swim. The welcome at Laamu was very friendly and we got to meet all main staff members. We also got to meet our GM. We stayed in a beach villa. I personnally would not advise‚Ä¶"
"Absolutely amazing time here for our honeymoon!!!  An extraordinary amount of time and effort was put into designing this resort to make it a fun place for guests.  There's a lot to take advantage of.  I would say it has a hip feel to it, but also great for families.  So it depends if you're looking to stay at a resort that I would first describe as ""cool/hip.""  But the service was perfect and we really enjoyed it.  We stayed at 2 resorts, one for relaxation/seclusion/bliss and a little more romantic, and this one to have more activities and interaction with other guests.  Pick your poison :)  Shout outs: Jenny - the best darn guest experience manager (GEM) anyone could dream to have, no really.  Not only does her persona make you always want to smile, but she did everything‚Ä¶"
"Six Sense Laamu is a brand new resort since April 2011, being the first and only resort located at the Laamu atoll, we  experienced something really remote  and different from other resorts located in the North and South Male atoll.   There is a long way to reach the heaven, after checked in at the domestic flight counter with the Six Senses staff , we were guided to the domestic flight lounge at 09:00am. (the lounge is for guests who go to other resort as well, hence it could be a bit crowd ), our original flight time was 10:40am., food are served for free in a la carte bases (selection of juices and sandwiches), the quality is quite ok, with complimentary wifi which helps you to kill time. Unfortunately, we waited until 11:50am. before we could get on the plane due to some‚Ä¶"

Villa No. 69 , it was more privacy more than others .. cause it was the last villa in the third line .. it was facing the sun rise ,, and the moon shine ... the staff was great , helpful very kind .. the manager himself was so kind and welcome us when we arrived and you can see him every where , every time .. God bless him and his staff .. everything you need is there from tooth paste to a needle ..  the food was great .. as we are muslim and we dont eat pork or drinks alcohols.. the staff were always notify us which food contain such kinds ... that was so appreciated ..  Thank you six senses laamu :)"
"Setting is beautiful in Lamuu on its own atoll with most of the restaurants and bar areas over the water.  Stayed in a water bungalow on pier A, was huge with enormous private deck area, double lounger, loads of space to chill out in the shade if needed, nets over the water, sliding doors to open up whole room onto deck.  Outdoor shower and bath area awesome. You must have a moonlight bath with the french windows open, music one gazing down to the sea below through the perspex base of the bath!  Room well kitted out with everything needed including hats, suncream, aloe gel, and a list of anything extra you could think of.  Pillow choices and room scents nice touch, as were the personalised number plates on the bikes for each bungalow.  Food is outstanding, we dined at Leaf as‚Ä¶"
"One of the best accomodations we have ever visited. Friendly staff and personel, great restaurant, one of the best places to dive. For sure not the last time we visited this paradise!"
"We have had a great holiday. The staff was very friendly and professional. Great service, we are all spoiled. The restaurants offered mouth-watering meals and our villa was very luxurious. We have enjoyed every minute on the beautiful island: snorkeling, swimming, surfing, aerobics, dolphins cruise and enjoy the beautiful nature. The kids had their best holiday ever. We definitely come back to this paradise on earth!"
"Amazing place to chill-out in an eco-chic ambience. This place looks like paradise. Very stylish villas with all the amenities you need. Food is very good, mostly fresh from the organic garden. Only downside it's a bit far (you have to take the plane) and there's no swimming pool. But I rather swim in the evian like big ocean in front of your villa, so I think you don't need a pool in the Maldives. The spa with the bird nest treatment rooms is really special. Only the prices are a bit too high but all the treatment we had were an amazing experience.  Very nice Dutch general manager. One of the most exclusive and beautiful resorts we've ever stayed. We really want to come back."
"Just came back with my wife for our honeymoon at SS Laamu. The place was magnificent, we were satisfied by the room, restaurant and service. After some hard months of organizing the wedding, we finally found time to enjoy and relax, and SS Laamu is totally that, relaxation and quality. We decided to come back on our second anniversary, so you will hear from us soon :)  PS: Special thanks to Irena- she made us feel very comfortable, an excellent host that makes the resort even better. The same applies for Mr. Jorge from Barcelona, I never received a better understanding and service from anyone. Calm and possitive, I think that he is the total meaning of Six Senses. Thank you for all!!  Sam Giannis"
"Just had a week in Six Senses Laamu for our honeymoon. Right from landing in Male we were greeted and looked after like a king and queen right up until we flew out. This is a very special and magical place. We stayed in an over water villa which was spacious, beautifully appointed and private. Sun bathing and swimming from your own private deck, the water is crystal clear and the sea life is amazing! A week at a resort is normally a long time for us but we could have stayed for months. There is plenty to do, surfing is world class and there is a great range water sports. the spa is excellent and there is a great range of restaurants. And best of all in the evenings, Chill Bar was the perfect place to relax and enjoy the great music and entertainment from DJ Barel, amazing to‚Ä¶"
"Go there when it's still cheap!!! This property is very good value for money. As compare to three other resorts I have been, this place is quite nice and cheap.   pro: New property. So rooms are in good conditions. They provide a bike for each guest. so it kinda fun but it maybe an disadvantage for senoir persons at the some time.   Cons: It is located far from Male. So quite exhausted if your flight landed in Male in evening or you may have to wait for long time at airport to get an domestic flight. Anyway they provide a lounge to wait but not exclusive lounge for the hotel like when you travelling with seaplane.  The reason I gave this property only 4 because their services is not perfect. Some good such as Jerry the restaurant manager. He tried to find us the best table. Some‚Ä¶"
My family and I have just returned from a fabulous stay at Six Senses Laamu. On the outward journey we were met at the airport and simply crossed the road to the awaiting speed boat which whisked us off to the island. From this moment on we experienced the holiday of a lifetime.  Our villa was a fabulous large room with an upstairs balcony and a large bathroom and an out door deck with steps right down in to the bluest warmest sea I have ever swum in! I have experienced the Six Senses holiday before and they have a very unique style. The design of all the buildings is stunning - the main bar and restaurant area is literally built on stilts in the sea over looking a coral reef within easy swimming distance. Make sure you sip a cocktail at 6pm ish in the bar and watch as 20 or so‚Ä¶
"Beautiful grounds, impeccable taste, refined concept, exceptionally fabulous staff. Barel Wachtel, talented DJ in the evenings.  Fuad, talented waiter at breakfast.  Dive Centre team, professional and enthusiastic Waheed, Johnathan, all GREAT.  Definitely will go back ASAP"
"I never made the effort to write a review on anything connected to my trips, but I feel like I should write a short note on this resort. I don't want to praise it too much so it does not become too fully booked forever!   Bottom line-its is a great resort. Everything is top class. The best part is the staff. I want to say thanks to our GEM, Wahid, to Adam the surfer,  Barel the cool DJ, lovely Noema the baby sitter and Gerry in the resturant.  Thanks to you and all, Iris and Eran"
"I've been travelling a lot, visiting 5 continents and more than 50 countries BUT in Laamu i really had a feeling: The paradise has name Six Senses Laamu! Please, just go there to see, to feel and to bring to all your friends the spirit of eden. Fine nature, fine environment, fine service, fine food, excellent organization, happy people and the ocean full of dolfins.  The most beautifull sunrises and sunsets in my 45 years life. Special thahks for your excellent service and for all the efforts of the staff to make us happy! Congratulations for developers and for the management. See you soon!"
"Six Senses Laamu is just the most relaxing place I have ever been to, PARADISE ON EARTH.  You land on the neighbour island and have a 10 minutes speedboat ride in the middle of dolphins to get to the resort, the magic stars operating.  Then you arrive to this little private island with immaculate beaches, all wooden constructions giving you a 360 degrees view from wherever you are, a fabulous house reef for snorkeling, bike ways through the jungle, an excellent spa, an ice cream shop with more than 40 tastes, a jungle cinema twice a week at night, a chill bar with hamacs during the day and very good live music or chill-out DJ sessions in the evening, diverse restaurants with the most exquisite food from the organic garden and the best fruit juices, very dedicated service.

Six senses laamu is an amazing location and place to stay. If you want to escape the traditional marble and sanstone luxury hotel this is for you. All organic and using natural products to built the hotel the island is an oasis. We styed in Ocean villa 19 which i recommend to anyone wanting absolute privacy thats close to activites. Our GEM Hannah was fantastic and every member of staff was proffesional and went above and beyond. The food and wine selections were amazing and all at reasonable prices which surprises us before we went. The day spa was beautiful and there were more than enough activites to keep you occupied. The gym was well fitted out with the best view in the world. We will definantly be coming back and thank everyone at the resort for making out hooneymoon so‚Ä¶
"We have been to many Maldivian islands,including both Sonevas (same group), and Six Senses Laamu is at least as lovely as any of them. The water villas are beautiful and spacious, the ambiance superb, and its a great place for total relaxation. Breakfasts were excellent,with an early start worthwhile to sit right out by the sea. For lunch my wife very much enjoyed the buffet each day, while I availed of the ""starter only"", which allowed, amongst other things, a selection of the marvellous hams and cheeses available. The dinner menu was good, with more variety than often available in the Maldives. I should also mention the friendly and always helpful sommelier. The bar was pleasant, and with good service, though while we were there a poor live duo detracted from the atmosphere‚Ä¶"
"We loved this hotel! It was our first time at 6 senses and we were not disappointed: the great attention to details, charming rooms and sense of peace were really amazing. This was my 3rd trip to Maldives and I found Laamu to be the best atoll I strayed so far. The island is big enough not to get bored, the beach is really beautiful and the house reef great. We stayed in the water villa and were very happy with our room, even more since they accommodate our request to be on sunset side and at the end of the jetty. Our Gem, Wenlin, was also great and helped us to understand all the options available while not being too invasive, something I was really afraid off. Since I am pregnant I cannot do every activity I would usually do, like scuba diving and water sky, but I still‚Ä¶"
We spent three nights at a beach villa here - it really is a magical place. It's about a 50 minute flights from Male - this was on top of a 16 hour flight but it's well worth the journey.   We were warmly greeted by the General Manager Martine and her team who looked after us like we were old time friends. Our GEM (guest experience maker) was Hannah - who was always really pleasant and helpful.  We had some fantastic meals on the Island too - a memorable one being the Asian buffet night where we sampled some local Maldivian cuisine.  Could happily have stayed here for longer. Fantastic resort - congrats to the team & thank you for making it so memorable.
"Resort- The resort itself is absolutely beautiful and how far removed it is from the airport and other resorts made it feels isolated and the sea life and house reef was amazing.  The island is bigger than Soneva Gili, which we enjoyed riding around on our bikes. We saw turtles, spotted eagle rays and a ton of fish right outside our water villa.  The dive operations had a great staff and new equipment, however the free snorkeling gear was a bit sub par.  The gym is basic but overlooks the water with great views.  There is a beach on the opposite side of the water villas that offers water sports and lounge chairs, we did snorkeling and stand up paddle boarding.  The room- Smaller than Gili but better designed, we like the bathroom being off the main bedroom with the shower‚Ä¶"
"What a place...! This is THE place to chill out and recharge.   Being the only resort in the atoll, it's like having a private lagoon to yourself. If the resort is full (which I hope it always is, we want it to stay here), you can still feel the peace and tranquility you might want from a desert island vacation.  The food is great and chefs from across the world are working tirelessly to provide fresh, well cooked dishes to suit all tastes. The wine list is magnificent and spans the globe. It is served up with marvellous panache by their resident Sommelliers, Meridith and Ankush. If wine is not your thing, then it's cocktails or cold refreshing beer to quench your thirst.  There's a fabulous spa with knowledgable therapists, ready to soothe away your stress - or if it's exercise‚Ä¶"
"This was our second visit to a Maldives Six Senses property and our first to Laamu. Despite the fact that it is less than a year old, things are running very smoothly for the resort. For starters, they have picked a beautiful island with much to see and do. The dive shop is fully equipped and you can rent snorkel gear for free. Or if you wish to dive (as my partner and I did) the instructors are wonderful and the dive locations are spectacular and a short boat ride away. We rented the complimentary catamaran from the water sports shop for a couple days of sailing; a fantastic thing to do when the winds pick up. The restaurants were not disappointing with a lot of options (considering the size of the resort), and the in-room dining was equally great. Our room was fantastic... we‚Ä¶"
"Everything was great at Laamu Six Senses. One week in Paradise. Very kind persons. The best Diving Center I've ever seen! The sea is rich of fishes and colours. Quiet Hotel with all conforts at the top: rooms, Spa, Gym, Water Sports, Restaurants with excellent food, Wine from all over the world of the best Brands ....I could eat Parmesan Cheese and Parma Ham in Maldives!!!! My best experience on an Island in Maldives."
"My partner and i have just returned from Six Senses Laamu- it was a truly amazing holiday. Upon arrival we were greeted by our Gem Rasheed and taken straight to our water willa. I requested a sunset villa on jetty A, and we were given villa 7 which we were delighted with as its only a short walk to the restaurants and watersports centre and, as per request, it was facing sunset. The accomodation is very comfortable, spacious, and not overlooked by any other water villas. The quality of food is outstanding with an excellent choice for seafood and non seafood lovers... the vietnamese dinner cooked by Chef Nick on our last evening was fantastic... the atmosphere is extremley laid back and relaxing which is what we wanted. Of an evening there is live music / singing in the ‚Ä¶"
"It's hard to tell something that went wrong...Island, villas, beach, people, every detail has been studied and tailored for best expectation. We've been travelling a lot in beautiful sea places around the world (in maldives just twice) and we choosed Six Senses in Laamu even because of the water sport centre, really best you can require in terms of wide number of sports and professional approach of the staff. Villa has every thing you need without exceeding in unuseful luxury, beach in front of the villa is beautiful, we choosed ocean view beach villa: it is close to the services but you have your personal bicycle so don't  worry about logistics...) Dining is really fantastic, we preferred Latitude restaurant but wherever you go (3 restaurants, ice bar...etc) food is special and‚Ä¶"
"My family and I have heard about the Six Senses brand, so we decided to do a Six Senses tour. We started at Laamu, and let me tell you, it was a great experience. The flight to get there was long, but once you arrive, without your shoes due to their ""No Shoes, No News"" policy, you tend to forget the hours you spent in airports and airplanes.  We arrived late at night, but we were escorted by our GEM, Ajaz, which is something like a personal butler, and who for the next two days, was going to help us with everything.   The rooms are amazing, i loved the huge deck and the beds on them. The bathroom is big and kind of in the outside, and you feel that you are taking a shower over the water, and every villa has a see through glass bathtub. I mean, how cool is that! The water at the‚Ä¶"
"Just come back from a perfect, trouble-free week here with the family. The water villas were a joy to be in perfectly laid out, private and simple to operate the lighting (often a problem in modern suites).   There was plenty to do from an excellent house reef with turtle, reef shark, rays and a myriad of smaller fish - try swimming from the end of jetty A back round to the Chill bar all the way along the reef. We loved seeing the dolphins swimming past every morning en route from the outer reef into the lagoon. And the diving locally was excellent for bigger fish like Mantas and whale shark.   The sports beach offered plenty to do, waterskiing, sailing etc and curling up with a good book from the excellent library on the suspended nets over the water after a long lunch was a‚Ä¶"
"Been to a few resorts in maldives including hilton, four seasons, shangri-la. I think laamu compares quite favourably to them all. Quite a large island for maldives standards with lots of activities - both land and sea. Spa is among the best i have gone to with both great choice and quality masseuse. The gym is decent but anyway you can enjoy the breeze as you jog around the island. Great food and restaurant choice: we were there 10 nights and not sure we ate the same thing twice for dinner. The ice cream selection is also fantatstic! Dont come here trying to lose weight! Service was very friendly and made us feel extremely welcome. We had a 5 month old boy and the staff just loved him and wanted to hold him and treat him like a king. Overall, a great experience and highly‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses clearly train and communicate great messages to their staff. All our dealings with all staff members were fantastic. They are all amazing customer service operators, and they all deal with things immediately hence clearly they have been trained to make decisions rather than defer! The resort is beautiful, the villas amazing, the food brilliant. I wouldn't want to say too much as it would take away the surprise of discovering each new thing. One of the highlights was the winemakers dinner we attended at Leaf - this was a brilliant match of Chablis wines to 5 courses, and hosted by a visiting French winemaker. That's the beauty of Laamu, the experiences you can have whilst in the middle of nowhere on a barefoot island! Who said luxury has to be in a 3 piece suit and‚Ä¶"
"I work for British Airways and had the dreadful task of flying to the stunning Maldives, staying in this fantastic hotel and coming back and presenting this to our sales team.   When I arrived I very nearly passed out with excitement. There is no other word to describe this hotel other than Heaven! From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you are treated like Kings and Queens. I believe that there were a few teething problems when this hotel first opened but these have been well and truly ironed out now. All rooms are sensational, you feel like you are the only person on the island when you are in your room with your private beach stretching out in front of you. I stayed in a beach villa that had a roof top seating area and an amazing outdoor shower area with surround‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses Laamu was the most AMAZING place we have been to. Maldives is naturally beautiful with its crystal clear waters and soft light sand, but the service and attention to detail given to us by the staff at six senses laamu made it an unforgettable trip. We were treated in the best way possible by the most friendly staff right from the airport in arrivals all the way to departure. Our over water villa was pefect, and we woke up to the beautful sunsent each morning. The food was endless and desserts..... YUMMMMM.  We only stayed for 6 days as we were told that we may get bored, but we wish we stayed longer- it was serene, tranquil, and romantic. Wish we were back there! The best part of our honeymoon, definitley recommend it!!!!  Anthony and Alesia"
"Arriving from busy Bangkok at 11pm, we were greated by Marteyne the GM, our GEM and  suprisingly by the Kids Club Manager Shelomi. We have two children (3 and 4 years old).   It was our first time in the Maldives and a long awaited belated honeymoon trip. I had never put our children in a kids club before but ""the Den"" (as they call it) was what made our vacation really exceptionnal. My husband and I could enjoy a break without being worried about the children for they were being taken care of by Shelomi who had  them wrapped around her finger in no time, offering a series of outside and fun activities close to nature and using all that was available to her in her direct environment. High five my dear you are amazing. Magical moments on property were seeing dolphins jump in‚Ä¶"
"We stayed eight days in Six Senses Laamu in the Southern Atoll of Laamu in Maldives. This is my eight visit to different resorts and Atolls in the Maldives and we are very delighted with our stay.   RESORT OVERVIEW The resort is located in the remote Atoll called Laamu in the Southern of Maldives. The overwater villas and the layout and turquoise water reminded us of Four Seasons Bora Bora (but Six Senses had also great natural white sand beach as well). So far Six Senses is the only resort in the Atoll which makes it even more special. The remoteness and the lack of boat traffic (unlike North and South Male Atolls) is obvious. There is huge pod of dolphins coming from the channel in front of the main jetty and the main bar and restaurant each single day, from 7.30 maybe to 8.30‚Ä¶"
"It was a long journey from Manchester to Laamu with waits at Dubai & Male for connecting flights we finally arrived to a warm welcome (from the lovely Resident Manager Sophie and our GEM)  at the Six Sense Laamu jetty after approx 20 hrs travelling !.   The next 10 days were truly the ""no news no shoes experience"" - our water bungalow (Jetty A villa 11) was just what we needed to strip away all those stresses of life in the UK & for the full holiday we really didn't wear shoes to breakfast or evening dinner or anytime in between !  Our trikes were such fun to ride from the villa to breakfast etc daily.  After a few days total R&R we started our diving expeditions - Petra (Ocean Dimensions) with our regular dive instructors team Kim & Di made our diving fun, informative & safe.‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses Laamu delivers the usual Six Senses philosophy of rustic eco-luxe. From the moment you arrive your shoulders drop and you are guaranteed a life-enhancing stay.  Sophie was very welcoming and we appreciated her decison to check whether we wanted to go straight to our villa or be shown the main hub of the island first.   The journey is a little more challenging than some due to the Laamu Atoll's location, but I found the domestic flight plus speedboat absolutely fine even with a 5 year old in tow. The lounge at Male is perfectly adequate for killing time.   For us the highlights were: - the natural beauty of the island  - picnic on the sand bank - the warmth and quality of care and stimulation at the complimentary Kids Club. Shelmoli really understands what makes kids‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses Laamu is an absolutely magical spot. From the moment you arrive at the local airport and are whisked by speedboat to the island, you feel like you have.....""arrived"". Attention to detail is superb. You will feel like island royalty as you enjoy one of the exquisitely adorned villas, each with their own special part of the island made into your personal jungle or ocean playland.   From the nourishing juice shots before each meal, specially crafted for their health benefits, to the turn down service that prepares you for divine rest, nothing is overlooked. The staff is gracious and will become like family, you will never forget the brilliant light in their eyes or their engaging smiles as they ensure that your stay in paradise is as perfect as possible.

"We stayed in a beachside villa which was fantastic. The snorkeling was the highlight. We were surrounded by 5 turtles and saw eagle rays every day. Downsides were having to pay for water. This wasn't evian or any fancy mineral water. This was normal drinking water. Having paid a lot of money, you would expect that drinking water is free. For that reason I give it a value of 2.  Our GEM (Hannah)was grumpy but this isn't a reflection of all GEMS. We had a late flight and Hannah had organized a spare villa for us to have a shower. We went there and to our surprise it was occupied. It was a bigger surprise for the guests who were staying there. My friend had the senior GEM (sophie) and she was fantastic with helping me when I lost my waterproof camera. If unlucky, your room will‚Ä¶"
"Just got back from a week staying here. We were looked after like silk worms. Our GEM was great as were all the staff. Always smiling and friendly.   They are serious when they say its a barefoot resort. The first morning we had shoes on for breakfast and saw quickly that NO ONE had shoes on. Almost felt naked! haha.  Food was good and never felt like the menu was repeating itself. Breakfast was exceptional; the standard comparable to top asian hotels. Lunch we took as room service in our Villa. Dinner at both restaurants was a 3 course menu with 4 choices in each entree, main and dessert. If its not included in your package then its 35USD for breakfast, 45usd for lunch and 75 usd for dinner ( all prices plus 13,85% taxes) Bottles of wine start from about 45usd (quite drinkable)‚Ä¶"
"I knew that the house reef was not very good. But it turned out to be lower than my low expectation. This time it was ok because we moved to Banyan Tree which has a great house reef. If it is your first time in Maldives and you will stay at one place only, maybe Laamu is not the place.  Pros: The view from the room is fantastic. In this resort, you should stay in the room and we did so. Food is good. The picnic island (hide-away island?) was great. Beautiful corals and many colourful fish. The house reef is bad but small eagle rays regularly come. I saw them 2 times while I was snorkeling.  Cons: It's not Soneva Fushi or Soneva Gili. Much less people are working and that reflects service quality (Fortunately, my gem was good, thus the stay itself was very pleasant). My fried egg‚Ä¶"
"My friend and I have just returned from Six Senses Laamu and I can truly say this was the most wonderful travel experience I have ever had. The stunning beauty of the Maldives combined with the eco respecting beauty of the resorts design,  our GEM;s warm and ever available service, abundant and delicious food and that incredivle warm turquoise water  all made for an unforgettable travel experience. I love luxury resorts and have experienced many but the stay in an over water villa at Six Senses now tops my list! - Not to be missed!"

ONLY white sand, blue water, wood villa, no photos or video can show the really view of this amusing place. we were invited to the cocktail party, gala dinner, not so many asian, not mention from mainland. The arrangement is really romantic and in fact cost people so much effort, we knew later that it takes them around 5 hours, 30 people to arrange this gala dinner, we thank these lovely people so much!! the spa is also very good, oh, it is at the beach side, hearing the song of the sea, you will get easily relaxed...

Tuna sandwiches were made beforehand, and that is thoughtful by the resort.  Then, started the little issues. Room arrangements were not made as requested, even the pre-checklist was not attended too. At the next day, they made usnswitch room as they just discovered that the wifi was not working. Strange, for a newly opened resort.  We never saw our GEMS after the check-in. Having stayed before at another SS, I found that a little odd.

"I jst returned from a 4 day stay at the Six Senses Lamuu Resort in the Maldives. The resort is stunning, impeccably kept., and a true paradise.   We rented a beach villa, with private access to the whitest sandy beach I have ever seen and the bluest of turquiose waters. I prefer this to water villas as you get to feel and see the nature of the island. The villa was very nicely laid out, like a post modern hut, best of all was the tree house where we had our daily breakast and the outside showers which was so liberating.  The Food was not very memorable, with Buffets served in the main restaurant, which I thought was a bit de-classe. Howvever, the wine cellar was very well stocked, backed by a wonderfully passionate sommeliere, Meredith, that had just arrived fom the States. She‚Ä¶"

We are very impressed with the food, both in the restaurants and dining in the room, very good.  We are still here, so need to run we just wanted to share how much fun we are having :).....2 more days to go.  Oh and a special thank you to Wahid, our GEM is truly a Gem, very thoughtful great to chat to, personable and professional.   Thank you Six Senses Laamu"
"i have stayed at soneva gili 6 times, soneva Fushi 3 times and was keen to try Laamu - and I wasn't disappointed  i did not snorkel or dive as i have a young son and didn't want to spend time away from him but i did see a lot of people snorkelling and there were certainly a lot of fish around at breakfast time to see  we were in a beach villa - we had spent the previous week at soneva gili overwater and so wanted to be on land for the second week. It really was a lovely villa with such a wonderful bit of beach - the villa is extremely useable and you can open it all up - it really has been done very well indeed - the upstairs undercover seating area could do with a fan as it does get a bit hot but that really is being picky.

"My boyfriend and I stayed at Six Senses Laamu at the beginning of August for 7 days.  What we thought would be too long of a stay at one resort on one tiny island, turned out to be not long enough in what was a veritable paradise.    We stayed in a Water Villa and loved it!  It was magical...everything from the outdoor shower, glass bathtub, beautiful deck with unending view on the ocean and access to the most amazing water you've ever seen, to our dream-enducing bed.  Our GEM (aka personal butler), Inthi, was great and very attentive to us from our arrival to departure.

"Ever since our honeymoon at Baros Maldives, my husband and I have always wanted to go back to the Maldives for another romantice getaway.  So when Six Senses Laamu opened this year and had an opening special, we leapt at the chance.  We travelled with his parents and took 2 separate water villas.  The journey to Laamu was a little tedious as we had to take another 45min internal flight from Male airport, and then hop onto a 20min speed boat ride.  The transfers all the way was well taken care of by the Six Senses representatives, however, I was a  little surprised when they did not offer the guests any water or cold towel during the speed boat ride after the long journey getting there.  I had assumed that this was the standard practise for a resort like Six Senses.  As we‚Ä¶"

"My wife and I just returned from a 9 night stay in a water villa at Six Senses Laamu.  The resort was fantastic, from the outstanding layout and attention to detail of our Water Villa (jetty A is the best...) to the great food and impeccable service.    Our GEM Saddam was great, and did his best to ensure that we had a good time.  Staff where all well trained and friendly and we where well looked after by the management team.  The only downside on the trip unfortunately was the separate company Ocean Dimensions that run the watersports.  The staff where friendly, and the surf instructor/guide Steve was a great guy, but unfortunately the owner Marc put a real damper on our trip.  He was rude and obnoxious and we felt that it was all about charging as much as possible without any‚Ä¶"
"We stayed 7 nights in Jetty A, Water Villa 11. Our view was uninterrupted with no other villas in our line of sight. We requested this in advance and were given confirmation via e-mail; I'd recommend you do the same to avoid the same disappointment as the guests below.  We felt that we had several choices for activities and excursions during the day. You can rent snorkelling gear from the dive shop for free and snorkel right in front of your villa. There was a great deal of sea life just a few yards away from ours. We also went on a private guided snorkelling excursion ($250) to the nearby Blue Lagoon which was quite nice. We also used the spa a few times, which was pricey ($260 for a hot stone massage), but the treatments were great quality and well worth it. There is a gym and‚Ä¶"
"Our wife and I just came back from Six Senses Laamu. We stayed at the facility for 5 days on their water bungalows with half board.  Overall, we are very impressed with how new the hotel is; however, staffs and hotel management require plenty of work for a hotel of their claimed status:  1) Arrival: Wife and I have requested over several emails to be stayed at Jetty A. However, upon arrival, we were taken by our customer representative (GEM). About half way on our buggy ride, GEM notified us that Jetty A is not available and told us that it is ok to stay with Jetty C. Jetty C from the previous post is located very far away. It takes at least 20 minutes on a skilled mountain biker to get to the main facility, likely falling over on the sand now and then. We told them that this is‚Ä¶"
"We stayed at Laamu for 7 nights as part of our honeymoon in June, followed by a 5 night stay in Huvafen Fushi.  I have to say, before arriving, I was much more excited about Huvafen after reading all of the hype about it on Trip Advisor however, Laamu was a million times better than Huvafen in every respect, which has prompted me to write this review.     We were really made to feel special at Laamu from the second we were greeted off the boat (after the domestic plane ride which, although may seem like a long transfer, gives you spectacular ariel views of the Maldives and is well worth the journey!) to the moment we left (at 6am in the morning being waved off by numerous staff).  Our overwater bungalow was very private at the end of the jetty and bikes are used to travel around‚Ä¶"
"I stayed there 5 nights from end of June 2011 with half-board meal plan and opening promotion.  This was my second visit to Maldives and this time for snorkeling.  Although there were a few minor issues, I was very happy with my stay there.   Weather My travel agent recommended to stay at southern Maldives for comparatively calmer weather.  It rained only once for around 1-2 hours in the first morning and the sky was overcast in the first day.  The rest of my stay was sunny and hot.  However, it was very windy and the sea choppy throughout my stay. Arrival It was already 2:00a.m. (Lammu time) when I arrived the resort after a very long journey.  The ‚Äúshort‚Äù introduction of resort facilities by the GEM became undesirably long.  When my GEM first took another couple into their‚Ä¶"
"Heard of Six Senses before but never try any of their properties, so hit the newest one in Laamu Atoll in mid-June! It‚Äôs pricey but still a good deal for take five get seven nights including half board; domestic flight and boat transfer from Male. However, the resort will arrange the domestic flight for you a day before on your arrival & departure. It‚Äôs really frustrating as the flight is operated by Q2 Maldivian Air & the schedule changes all the time.  You never know what kind of plane you‚Äôll fly until the time to check-in and weighing your luggage including YOURSELF‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt eat heavily before your fly with them.  We paid extra US$280 to stay in nearby Traders Hotel on arrival Male at night time but you can still catch the domestic flight at 2330hrs and reach the resort in very‚Ä¶"
"This is a great hotel ‚Äì no doubt. Great concept, great hotel, great food. Try the Leaf restaurant -- 5 star food. Great concept, slow life all the way - great to eat - love the no shoes concept ;-) Great snorkeling, great diving. The Laamu diving team - they will do anything to make you happy, and they now their way around to the great diving sites, and they do it for a bargain"
"Stayed there for 7 nights end June to begining of July,very smooth arrival at 3am resort time and the GEM(Guest Experience Manager) stayed up and welcome us. Very crowded resort especially during breakfast and dinner since they have the opening special of free HB (Half Board) for the entire stay. Good: The water villa layout and features, staff in the restaurant and housekeeping, the restaurant location (over the water), house reef location and the snorkelling equipment, bicycle offered for going around the island, but sometimes difficult to ride on the sand Bad: not enough GEM to take care of th guests, but you do see different quality and level of service offered by GEM, need more training in this area. The GM cocktails evening is a not as good as the one that I have‚Ä¶"
"Six Senses is certainly a heaven on earth.  We were very lucky during our stay there as the weather was perfect and there were not many guests at the hotel.  I've read some comments which said there were lots of insects inside the villa when it was raining.   The villa is stunning and is totally value-for-money given the opening promotion.  The breakfast is the best I've ever had.  The staff are friendly, helpful and professional.  I had a stomache one night and called the reception at 3am.  Our personal manager appeared at my door shortly afterwards with the medicine I needed.  The next day I was too tired to go out for breakfast, and the hotel staff offered to deliver the breakfast to my villa!  I also love the bicycles provided.  It's a great idea as the resort is quite large‚Ä¶"
We picked the Six Senses Laamu as the resort we decided to stay at for our second week in the Maldives.  We spent the first week at the Four Seasons resort in the North Male Atoll and felt like staying at the 2 resorts would provide some variation to our vacation.  It also provided a good contrast in experiences.  Prior to writing this review I went back to the Six Senses web-site to re read what is advertised by the resort as their services and features.  I think what is extremely key to understanding this resort is their approach or philosophy (slowlife) and whether the offering will match what you want out of your vacation.  The transfer from the Male Intl airport can be frustrating.  At the time that we traveled there were only 2 confirmed flights to the Laamu atoll one in‚Ä¶
"Six Senses Laamu must be as close as it gets to most people's idea of paradise. The resort is simply stunning and we enjoyed our stay in every way.  Our water villa was specious and  very well designed with the most amazing sea view in all directions. A lot of wood, glass and net are used to put you closest possible to nature yet with all the modern comforts. I particularly like the bathroom especially the shower area overlooking the bluest of blue indian ocean, probably the best shower I have had.  Breakfast was always excellent with fresh fruits and waffle being my personal highlights. What compliments the meal so well was the amazing setting - in a deplex wooden pavillion built over the water, taking full advantage of the stunning scenery and cool sea breeze. Breakfast time‚Ä¶"
"Words can¬¥t say it..... You have to be there to imagine the paradise...  Room: (Water Villa 8 - in jetty A) Perfect view with fantastic sunsets every night.... Everything new but made with a perfect touch of ""blending"" in to the nature... All material wood and a lot of nice details in the room.. Hidden tv i wall to be used 2 directions... One when staying in room - but also reverse with taking shower or using the bathtub outside... You could watch TV/Music to add the romantic feeling.. Free bikes included to use - very nice touch ! Free wireless internet (a bit slow)  Restaurants.... WOW....we had bought a full board package (part of opening offer) and mush say.... The food was really amazing in so high quality... A real 5 star .....!!! The a la carte service was wonderful - and‚Ä¶"
"Writing this review on my last day, lounging on the porch of my water villa. The resort is amazing and built with simplicity and elegance!  All the staff are attentive and friendly!  From our gem Saddam who took the initiative to follow up on an room change when we told him of our mosquito bites and went out of his way to provide me a tricycle, to the surf instructor Steve who offered a swim lesson when he found out I had trouble swimming, and Lana who goes out of her way to keep the public informed of the resort and answer all the questions of future guests. At a cocktail party I had mentioned a lifesaver was missing from my villa to Lana and the next day it was there!    At Longitude, there was our favorite Vietnamese fruit chef during breakfast who worked hard to prepare cuts‚Ä¶"
"Having recently returned from our Honeymoon at this amazing resort, we felt compelled to write a review with it fresh in our minds‚Ä¶ Working in the hospitality industry ourselves, we can be very critical, however I am pleased to say this property exceeded our expectations with both its facilities and services. We felt the whole experience from the arrival at Male‚Äôs International Airport, to the arrangement of the domestic transfer and finally the arrival by speedboat at the resort was well executed and we were always met with smiling associates (hosts) of the resort. We stayed in a water villa which was ample in size and our GEM (Guest Experience Maker) Waheed was always on-hand and made us feel like he was only looking after us, throughout our whole stay. We stayed at Six Senses‚Ä¶"
"Beautiful place, several small issues having just opened, slow service etc but are easily fixed and the management wrote to us after seeking feedback to say they were fixing the issues. Food was good, not amazing but good. All that aside, if you get the chance to go here you should. It is an amazing and beautiful place, the villas are just unbelievable and it was so relaxing and the staff were very friendly. Snorkeling is great, the water is so clear, the dolphins pass by each morning, it's just amazing"
"Six Senses Laamu is in my opinion the nectar of 15 years of hard work within the frame of Six Senses.  Six Senses Laamu is unique and breathtaking - from start to end, and maybe also beyond. It is an Island dream vacation !  It is the best from the best - it is the best of the best.  It is one of a very few places in the world that now and will call your sub-conscious, and remind you  -  that you have to come back.  Personally I only have this call from the region of French Polynesia.  My family (My wife & our 2 girls, 5 & 8) and I, had the great chance to visit Six Senses Laamu first week of May 2011,  a few weeks after the resort had opened to public.  Detailed description of our out of the ordinary luxury vacation experience,  would be faaar to long to describe here. Also, it‚Ä¶"
"This place is simply amazing.   My husband and I went there for our honeymoon in April 2011 and had an absolute ball. Despite arriving just a few days after its official opening, we didn't experience any of the usual ""teething"" problems associated with new resorts. Management had clearly waited until the resort was well and truly ready before opening its doors to guests.   Apart from the stunning blue water and white sandy beaches,the resort itself is visually spectacular.   The main foyer and restaurant areas are all constructed above the water and are connected by walkways which gives the place a tree house feel. Everything on the resort is designed to take full advantage of the natural beauty of the surrounds. The resort is very stylish and innovative yet harmonious with the‚Ä¶"
